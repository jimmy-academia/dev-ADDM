# === OVERVIEW (generates Overview section) ===
overview:
  title: "Capacity Management Assessment"

  purpose: |
    Help assess how well this restaurant handles customer volume using reviews as evidence.
    This is from the perspective of a business owner diagnosing staffing and capacity issues.
    Assign a label: Needs Improvement, Satisfactory, or Excellent.

  incident_definition: |
    Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
    - staffing levels relative to busyness
    - how crowded the restaurant was
    - whether service suffered when busy
    - peak time handling (weekends, holidays)

    Reviews that only discuss food quality without mentioning capacity carry less weight.
