overview:
  title: "Execution Quality Assessment"

  purpose: |
    Help assess how well this restaurant executes orders and keeps promises using reviews as evidence.
    This is from the perspective of a business owner diagnosing operational issues.
    Assign a label: Needs Improvement, Satisfactory, or Excellent.

    This assessment uses a point-based scoring system to quantify performance.

  incident_definition: |
    Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
    - order accuracy (correct items, modifications)
    - promises made and kept
    - how issues were resolved
    - menu accuracy and descriptions

    Reviews that only discuss ambiance without mentioning order execution carry less weight.
