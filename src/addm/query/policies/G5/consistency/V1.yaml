  title: "Consistency Assessment"

  purpose: |
    Help assess the quality consistency at this restaurant using reviews as evidence.
    This is from the perspective of a business owner diagnosing reliability.
    Assign a label: Needs Improvement, Satisfactory, or Excellent.

  incident_definition: |
    Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
    - quality changes over time
    - comparison to previous visits
    - reliability and predictability
    - repeat customer observations

    Reviews from first-time visitors that don't mention consistency carry less weight.
