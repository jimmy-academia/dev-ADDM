# === OVERVIEW (generates Overview section) ===
overview:
  title: "Dietary Accommodation Risk Assessment"

  purpose: |
    Help assess the dietary accommodation risk for this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
    Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

    This assessment uses a point-based scoring system with recency weighting.

  incident_definition: |
    Only firsthand accounts are treated as confirmed evidence. An account is
    considered relevant if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:
    - requesting accommodation for a dietary restriction (gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian)
    - staff response to dietary restriction requests
    - incidents where restricted foods were served despite requests
    - menu labeling or ingredient transparency

    General food preference mentions (e.g., "I like vegan food") are NOT considered
    incidents unless they describe an accommodation attempt.

  scoring:
    description: |
      Calculate a total risk score by summing points from all firsthand dietary incidents,
      with recency weighting applied.

    severity_points:
      - label: "Mild incident"
        points: 2
      - label: "Moderate incident"
        points: 5
      - label: "Severe incident"
        points: 15

    modifiers:
      - label: "False assurance"
        description: "incident after staff confirmed food was safe for restriction"
        points: 5
      - label: "Dismissive staff"
        description: "staff dismissed dietary concern or was rude about request"
        points: 3
      - label: "Medical restriction"
        description: "restriction is medical (celiac, allergy) rather than preference"
        points: 2

      - age: "Within 2 years"
        weight: "full point value"

      - age: "Over 3 years old"
        weight: "quarter point value (multiply by 0.25), or discard entirely if 3+ recent reviews show improved accommodation"
