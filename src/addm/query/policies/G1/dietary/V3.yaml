  title: Dietary Accommodation Risk Assessment
  purpose: |
    Help assess the dietary accommodation risk for this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
    Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

    This assessment uses a point-based scoring system to quantify risk.
  incident_definition: |
    Only firsthand accounts are treated as confirmed evidence. An account is
    considered relevant if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:
    - requesting accommodation for a dietary restriction (gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian)
    - staff response to dietary restriction requests
    - incidents where restricted foods were served despite requests
    - menu labeling or ingredient transparency

    General food preference mentions (e.g., "I like vegan food") are NOT considered
    incidents unless they describe an accommodation attempt.
