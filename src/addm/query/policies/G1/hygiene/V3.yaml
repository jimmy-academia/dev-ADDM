# === OVERVIEW (generates Overview section) ===
overview:
  title: "Hygiene and Food Safety Risk Assessment"

  purpose: |
    Help assess the hygiene and food safety risk for this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
    Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

    This assessment uses a point-based scoring system with recency weighting.

  incident_definition: |
    Only firsthand observations are treated as confirmed evidence. An account is
    considered relevant if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:
    - visible cleanliness issues (dirty tables, floors, kitchen, bathroom)
    - pest sightings (insects, rodents)
    - food safety concerns (hair in food, undercooked, spoiled)
    - illness after eating at the restaurant

    Vague statements without specific observations (e.g., "seemed clean") carry less weight.

  scoring:
    description: |
      Calculate a total risk score by summing points from all firsthand hygiene incidents,
      with recency weighting applied.

      - label: "Minor issue"
        points: 2
      - label: "Major issue"
        points: 5
      - label: "Severe issue (illness, rodent)"
        points: 15

    modifiers:
      - label: "Food poisoning"
        description: "reviewer or party got sick after eating"
        points: 10

      - age: "Over 2 years old"
        weight: "quarter point value (multiply by 0.25), or discard entirely if 3+ recent reviews confirm cleanliness improvement"
