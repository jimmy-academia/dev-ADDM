# === OVERVIEW (generates Overview section) ===
overview:
  title: "Hygiene and Food Safety Risk Assessment"

  purpose: |
    Help assess the hygiene and food safety risk for this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
    Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

  incident_definition: |
    Only firsthand observations are treated as confirmed evidence. An account is
    considered relevant if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:
    - visible cleanliness issues (dirty tables, floors, kitchen, bathroom)
    - pest sightings (insects, rodents)
    - food safety concerns (hair in food, undercooked, spoiled)
    - illness after eating at the restaurant

    Vague statements without specific observations (e.g., "seemed clean") carry less weight.
