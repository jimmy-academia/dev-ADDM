# G1_allergy_V0: Base Allergy Safety Risk Assessment
# V0 = Base: Simple per-instance reasoning, basic thresholds

policy_id: "G1_allergy_V0"
version: "1.0"

# === OVERVIEW (generates Overview section) ===
overview:
  purpose: |
    Assign a restaurant an Allergy Safety Risk label (Low Risk / High Risk / Critical Risk)
    using customer reviews as evidence.

  evidence_scope: |
    A review is considered allergy-relevant if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:
    - an allergic reaction or suspected cross-contact
    - requesting allergy accommodation (e.g., "peanut allergy", "nut-free")
    - staff communication about allergy safety
    - explicit statements about allergy safety guarantees (e.g., "they assured it was nut-free")

    Ingredient mentions without allergy context (e.g., "peanut sauce is great") are NOT considered allergy-relevant.
