  title: "Allergy Safety Risk Assessment"

  purpose: |
    Help assess the allergy safety risk for this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
    Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

  incident_definition: |
    Only firsthand accounts are treated as confirmed incident evidence. An account is
    considered an incident if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:
    - an allergic reaction or suspected cross-contact
    - requesting allergy accommodation (e.g., "peanut allergy", "nut-free")
    - staff communication about allergy safety
    - explicit statements about allergy safety guarantees (e.g., "they assured it was nut-free")

    Ingredient mentions without allergy context (e.g., "peanut sauce is great") are
    NOT considered incidents but ARE considered allergy-relevant.
