# G1_allergy_V3: Allergy Safety with Policy Update
# V3 = Update: Realistic policy change (exception for old incidents, stricter thresholds)

policy_id: "G1_allergy_V3"
extends: "G1_allergy_V2"
version: "1.0"

# === OVERVIEW (generates Overview section) ===
overview:
  purpose: |
    Assign a restaurant an Allergy Safety Risk label (Low Risk / High Risk / Critical Risk)
    using customer reviews as evidence.

  evidence_scope: |
    A review is considered allergy-relevant if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:
    - an allergic reaction or suspected cross-contact
    - requesting allergy accommodation (e.g., "peanut allergy", "nut-free")
    - staff communication about allergy safety
    - explicit statements about allergy safety guarantees (e.g., "they assured it was nut-free")

    Ingredient mentions without allergy context (e.g., "peanut sauce is great") are NOT considered allergy-relevant.

    **Recency principle**: More recent incidents weigh more heavily than older incidents.
    However, severe incidents remain important even if older.

    **Policy update (V3)**: Incidents older than 3 years may be discounted if there is
    substantial recent evidence of improved handling. This exception does NOT apply
    to severe incidents.
