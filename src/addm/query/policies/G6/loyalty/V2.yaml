# === OVERVIEW (generates Overview section) ===
overview:
  title: "Customer Loyalty Assessment"

  purpose: |
    Help assess customer loyalty and retention indicators using reviews as evidence.
    This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating customer loyalty.
    Assign a label: Low Loyalty, Moderate Loyalty, or High Loyalty.

  incident_definition: |
    Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
    - return visits or intention to return
    - recommendations to others
    - emotional attachment or connection
    - loyalty despite issues

    Reviews from first-time visitors that don't mention return intent carry less weight.
