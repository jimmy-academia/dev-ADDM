# === OVERVIEW (generates Overview section) ===
overview:
  title: "Uniqueness Assessment"

  purpose: |
    Help assess how unique and differentiated this restaurant is using reviews as evidence.
    This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating competitive positioning.
    Assign a label: Generic, Differentiated, or Highly Unique.

  incident_definition: |
    Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
    - what makes the restaurant special or different
    - signature dishes or unique offerings
    - memorable experiences
    - comparisons to other restaurants

    Reviews that don't mention distinctiveness or memorability carry less weight.
