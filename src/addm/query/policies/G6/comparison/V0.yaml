  purpose: |
    Help assess how this restaurant compares to competitors using reviews as evidence.
    This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating competitive position.
    Assign a label: Weaker, Comparable, or Stronger.

  incident_definition: |
    Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
    - comparisons to other restaurants
    - preferences between this and competitors
