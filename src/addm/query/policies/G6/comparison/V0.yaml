  title: "Competitive Comparison Assessment"

  purpose: |
    Help assess how this restaurant compares to competitors using reviews as evidence.
    This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating competitive position.
    Assign a label: Weaker, Comparable, or Stronger.

  incident_definition: |
    Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
    - comparisons to other restaurants
    - preferences between this and competitors
    - switching behavior (to or from)
    - relative strengths and weaknesses

    Reviews that don't mention competitors or comparisons carry less weight.
