  title: "Price-Worth Value Assessment"

  purpose: |
    Help assess the value-for-money at this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
    Assign a value label: Poor Value, Fair Value, or Good Value.

  incident_definition: |
    Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
    - price perception (expensive, cheap, worth it)
    - portion sizes relative to price
    - quality relative to price
    - deals, happy hours, lunch specials
    - overall value assessment

    Reviews that only discuss food quality without mentioning price carry less weight.
