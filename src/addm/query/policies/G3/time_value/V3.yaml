  title: Time-Value Assessment
  purpose: |
    Help assess whether waiting at this restaurant is worth it using customer reviews as evidence.
    Assign a verdict: Not Worth Waiting, Worth Waiting, or Definitely Worth Waiting.

    This assessment uses a point-based scoring system to quantify time-value.
  incident_definition: |
    Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
    - wait times for seating, food, or service
    - reservations and whether they were honored
    - whether the wait was justified by the experience
    - willingness to wait again

    Reviews that don't mention timing or waiting carry less weight.
