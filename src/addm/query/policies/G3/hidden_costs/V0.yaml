overview:
  title: Hidden Costs Risk Assessment
  purpose: |
    Help assess the risk of unexpected charges at this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
    Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.
  incident_definition: |
    Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
    - unexpected charges on the bill
    - mandatory service charges or auto-gratuity
    - corkage fees, split fees, or other surcharges
    - bill surprises or lack of price transparency
    - fine print charges

    Reviews that only discuss food without mentioning billing carry less weight.
