overview:
  title: "Group Dining Suitability Assessment"

  purpose: |
    Help assess how suitable this restaurant is for group dining (large parties, celebrations, family gatherings)
    using customer reviews as evidence.
    Assign a suitability label: Not Recommended, Acceptable, or Recommended.

  incident_definition: |
    Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
    - large group dining, parties, celebrations, birthday dinners
    - ability to accommodate large parties
    - wait times for groups, reservation handling
    - check splitting, group service coordination
    - family-friendliness (if relevant)

    Reviews from solo diners or couples carry less weight unless they comment on observed group experiences.
