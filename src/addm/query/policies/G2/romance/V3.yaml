overview:
  title: "Romantic Dining Suitability Assessment"

  purpose: |
    Help assess how suitable this restaurant is for romantic dining (dates, anniversaries, proposals)
    using customer reviews as evidence.
    Assign a suitability label: Not Recommended, Acceptable, or Recommended.

    This assessment uses a point-based scoring system with recency weighting.

  incident_definition: |
    Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
    - date nights, anniversaries, romantic occasions, proposals
    - ambiance, lighting, noise level, privacy
    - service style (rushed vs. attentive)
    - overall romantic atmosphere

    Reviews that only discuss food without mentioning atmosphere carry less weight.
