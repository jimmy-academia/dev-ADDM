overview:
  title: "Business Dining Suitability Assessment"

  purpose: |
    Help assess how suitable this restaurant is for business dining (client meetings, work lunches, interviews)
    using customer reviews as evidence.
    Assign a suitability label: Not Recommended, Acceptable, or Recommended.

  incident_definition: |
    Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
    - business lunches, client meetings, interviews, work events
    - noise level and ability to have conversation
    - service efficiency and professionalism
    - privacy for business discussions
    - overall professional atmosphere

    Reviews that only discuss food without mentioning the business context carry less weight.
