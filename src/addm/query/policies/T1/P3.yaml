# T1_allergy_P3: Allergy Safety - ALL Logic Rule Variation
# P3 = ALL Logic: Requires multiple conditions to ALL be true (stricter than P1/P2)
# Key difference: P1/P2 use ANY (one condition triggers), P3 uses ALL (all conditions must apply)

overview:
  title: "Allergy Safety Risk Assessment (Strict)"

  purpose: |
    Help assess the allergy safety risk for this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
    Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

    This policy uses strict ALL logic: multiple factors must ALL be present to trigger
    higher risk verdicts. A severe incident alone is not sufficient for Critical Risk;
    it must be accompanied by poor staff response.

  incident_definition: |
    Only firsthand accounts are treated as confirmed incident evidence. An account is
    considered an incident if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:
    - an allergic reaction or suspected cross-contact
    - requesting allergy accommodation (e.g., "peanut allergy", "nut-free")
    - staff communication about allergy safety
    - explicit statements about allergy safety guarantees (e.g., "they assured it was nut-free")

    Ingredient mentions without allergy context (e.g., "peanut sauce is great") are
    NOT considered incidents but ARE considered allergy-relevant.
