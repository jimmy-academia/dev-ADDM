  ALLERGY SAFETY RISK ASSESSMENT

  This assessment helps evaluate allergy safety risk for restaurants using customer reviews
  as evidence. The goal is to assign one of three risk labels: Low Risk, High Risk, or
  Critical Risk.

  When analyzing reviews, we focus on firsthand accounts as confirmed incident evidence.
  A firsthand account is when the reviewer or their dining party directly experienced the
  event, such as saying "I had an allergic reaction" or "my child broke out in hives."
  Secondhand reports where the reviewer describes someone else's experience do not count
  as confirmed evidence. Hypothetical concerns without describing an actual incident are
  also not counted.

  An account is considered an incident if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:
  an allergic reaction or suspected cross-contact, requesting allergy accommodation such
  as mentioning a peanut allergy or asking for nut-free options, staff communication about
  allergy safety, or explicit statements about allergy safety guarantees. Ingredient
  mentions without allergy context, such as praising the peanut sauce, are not considered
  incidents but are still considered allergy-relevant.

  When analyzing incident severity, we consider multiple levels. Severe incidents involve
  life-threatening reactions such as anaphylaxis, EpiPen use, emergency room visits, or
  hospitalization. Moderate incidents show visible symptoms like hives or swelling and
  may require medication such as antihistamines, but are not life-threatening. Mild
  incidents cause discomfort or minor symptoms without visible swelling, hives, or the
  need for urgent medical care. If no allergic reaction is described, the severity is none.

  We also track staff response to allergy concerns. Staff may have accommodated by taking
  the concern seriously with ingredient checks, substitutions, or separate preparation.
  They may have refused to accommodate, been dismissive by minimizing the concern, or
  there may be no staff interaction described. Additionally, we note whether staff
  explicitly assured the food was safe for the allergy, such as guaranteeing it was
  nut-free or confirming no peanuts were used.

  The verdict rules work as follows. A restaurant receives Critical Risk when at least
  one severe firsthand incident is reported, or when two or more moderate firsthand
  incidents are reported. High Risk applies when Critical Risk does not apply but at
  least one mild or moderate firsthand incident is reported. Otherwise, the default
  verdict is Low Risk, which is especially appropriate when no firsthand incidents are
  reported or when allergy-relevant reviews describe consistent accommodation behavior.
