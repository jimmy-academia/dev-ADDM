      <title>Allergy Safety Risk Assessment</title>
      <purpose>Help assess the allergy safety risk for this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence. Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.</purpose>
      <guidance>
        Only firsthand accounts are treated as confirmed incident evidence. An account is
        considered an incident if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:
        - an allergic reaction or suspected cross-contact
        - requesting allergy accommodation (e.g., "peanut allergy", "nut-free")
        - staff communication about allergy safety
        - explicit statements about allergy safety guarantees

        Ingredient mentions without allergy context (e.g., "peanut sauce is great") are
        NOT considered incidents but ARE considered allergy-relevant.
