  # Allergy Safety Risk Assessment

  Help assess the allergy safety risk for this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
  Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

  ## Verdict Rules

  A restaurant is considered **Critical Risk** if any of the following is true:
  - 1 or more severe firsthand incidents are reported
  - 2 or more moderate firsthand incidents are reported

  **High Risk** if Critical Risk does not apply, but any of the following is true:
  - 1 or more mild or moderate firsthand incidents are reported

  **Low Risk** otherwise, especially when:
  - No firsthand incidents are reported
  - Allergy-relevant reviews describe consistent accommodation behavior

  ## Definitions of Terms

  ### What to Consider (Guidance)

  Only firsthand accounts are treated as confirmed incident evidence. An account is
  considered an incident if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:
  - an allergic reaction or suspected cross-contact
  - requesting allergy accommodation (e.g., "peanut allergy", "nut-free")
  - staff communication about allergy safety
  - explicit statements about allergy safety guarantees (e.g., "they assured it was nut-free")

  Ingredient mentions without allergy context (e.g., "peanut sauce is great") are
  NOT considered incidents but ARE considered allergy-relevant.

  *Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

  ### Account Type
  How the reviewer relates to the described event

  - **firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
  - **secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
  - **hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

  ### Incident Severity
  Severity of allergic reaction if one occurred

  - **none**: No allergic reaction described
  - **mild**: Discomfort or minor symptoms that do not include visible swelling/hives and do not require urgent medical care
  - **moderate**: Visible symptoms (e.g., hives or swelling) and/or symptoms that required medication (e.g., antihistamine), but not life-threatening
  - **severe**: Life-threatening reaction, including any mention of anaphylaxis, EpiPen use, emergency room visit, hospitalization, or explicitly described medical emergency

  ### Assurance of Safety
  Whether staff explicitly assured the food was safe for the allergy

  - **true**: Review states an explicit assurance of safety (e.g., "guaranteed nut-free", "confirmed no peanuts", "assured it was safe for my allergy")
  - **false**: Review discusses allergy but contains no explicit assurance claim
  - **unknown**: Text is too vague to determine

  ### Staff Response
  How staff responded when the concern was raised

  - **accommodated**: Staff took the concern seriously and successfully accommodated (ingredient check, substitution, separate preparation, clear warnings)
  - **refused**: Staff stated they could not or would not accommodate
  - **dismissive**: Staff minimized the concern or did not take it seriously
  - **none**: No staff interaction about the concern is described
  - **unknown**: Unclear from the review
