  # Allergy Safety Risk Assessment

  Help assess the allergy safety risk for this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
  Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

  Only firsthand accounts count as confirmed evidence. Firsthand means the reviewer or their
  dining party experienced the event directly. Secondhand reports are not counted.

  ## Critical Risk

  Assign **Critical Risk** if ANY of the following:
  - 1+ severe incidents (life-threatening reactions, anaphylaxis, EpiPen use, ER visits)
  - 2+ moderate incidents (visible symptoms like hives/swelling, medication needed)

  *Only firsthand accounts count as evidence.*

  ## High Risk

  Assign **High Risk** if Critical Risk does not apply AND:
  - 1+ mild or moderate incidents (minor discomfort to visible symptoms)

  *Only firsthand accounts count as evidence.*

  ## Low Risk

  Assign **Low Risk** otherwise (default), especially when:
  - No firsthand incidents are reported
  - Reviews describe consistent accommodation behavior

  ## Term Definitions

  For reference, here are the complete definitions:

  **Account Type**: firsthand (reviewer experienced it), secondhand (heard from others), hypothetical (concern without incident)

  **Incident Severity**:
  - none: No reaction described
  - mild: Minor discomfort, no visible symptoms, no urgent care
  - moderate: Visible symptoms (hives, swelling), medication needed, not life-threatening
  - severe: Life-threatening, anaphylaxis, EpiPen, ER visit, hospitalization

  **Assurance of Safety**: true (explicit assurance given), false (no assurance), unknown (unclear)
