  title: "Server Performance Assessment"

  purpose: |
    Help assess the front-of-house staff performance at this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
    This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating their service team.
    Assign a performance label: Needs Improvement, Satisfactory, or Excellent.

  incident_definition: |
    Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
    - server attentiveness and responsiveness
    - friendliness and demeanor
    - menu knowledge and recommendations
    - service errors and how they were handled
    - exceptional servers mentioned by name

    Reviews that only discuss food without mentioning service carry less weight.
