# === OVERVIEW (generates Overview section) ===
overview:
  title: "Kitchen Performance Assessment"

  purpose: |
    Help assess the kitchen performance at this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
    This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating their kitchen team's execution.
    Assign a performance label: Needs Improvement, Satisfactory, or Excellent.

  incident_definition: |
    Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
    - food quality issues (temperature, doneness, taste)
    - consistency of food quality across visits
    - presentation and plating
    - chef skill level
    - food sent back or complaints addressed

    Reviews that only discuss service without mentioning food quality carry less weight.
