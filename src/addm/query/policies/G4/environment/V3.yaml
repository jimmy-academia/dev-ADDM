overview:
  title: "Environment Quality Assessment"

  purpose: |
    Help assess the physical environment quality at this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
    This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating ambiance and comfort.
    Assign a quality label: Needs Improvement, Satisfactory, or Excellent.

    This assessment uses a point-based scoring system with recency weighting.

  incident_definition: |
    Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
    - cleanliness of the space
    - noise level
    - seating comfort
    - temperature comfort (AC, heating)
    - ambiance and decor fit with concept

    Reviews that only discuss food or service without mentioning environment carry less weight.
