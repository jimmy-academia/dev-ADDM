  "prompt": "You are an expert at analyzing restaurant reviews for allergy safety concerns.\n\n\n# Allergy Safety Risk Assessment Standard (Review-Based)\n\n## Purpose / overall goal\nThis standard defines how we assign a restaurant an Allergy Safety Risk label (Low / High / Critical) for allergy safety, using customer reviews as evidence.\n\n## Evidence scope\nA review is considered allergy-relevant if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:\n- an allergic reaction or suspected cross-contact,\n- requesting allergy accommodation (e.g., \"peanut allergy,\" \"nut-free\"),\n- staff communication about allergy safety, or\n- explicit statements about allergy safety guarantees (e.g., \"they assured it was nut-free\").\n\nIngredient mentions without allergy context (e.g., \"peanut sauce is great\") are not considered allergy-relevant.\n\n## Definitions of terms\n\n### Account type\n- **Firsthand**: the reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., \"I had\u2026,\" \"my child\u2026\").\n- **Secondhand**: the reviewer reports someone else's experience (\"my friend\u2026\").\n- **Hypothetical / preference**: the reviewer expresses concern or preference without describing an incident (\"I'm allergic so I avoid\u2026\").\n\nOnly firsthand accounts are treated as confirmed incident evidence.\n\n### Incident severity\nIf a review describes an allergic reaction, classify severity as follows:\n- **Mild incident**: discomfort or minor symptoms that do not include visible swelling/hives and do not require urgent medical care.\n- **Moderate incident**: visible symptoms (e.g., hives or swelling) and/or symptoms that required medication (e.g., antihistamine), but the situation is not described as life-threatening.\n- **Severe incident**: a life-threatening reaction, including any mention of anaphylaxis, EpiPen use, emergency room visit, hospitalization, or an explicitly described medical emergency.\n\nIf no reaction occurred, the review is treated as non-incident evidence.\n\n### Assurance of safety\nAn assurance is present when staff are described as explicitly confirming safety for peanut/tree-nut allergy (e.g., \"guaranteed nut-free,\" \"confirmed no peanuts,\" \"assured it was safe for my allergy\").\n\nIf a firsthand incident occurs after such an assurance, this is treated as a high-severity policy failure signal, because it indicates breakdown of allergy-handling procedures or communication.\n\n### Staff response\nWhen described, staff response should be recorded as:\n- **Accommodated**: staff took the allergy seriously and made a successful adjustment (ingredient check, substitution, separate preparation, clear warnings).\n- **Refused**: staff stated they could not or would not accommodate allergies.\n- **Dismissive**: staff minimized the concern or treated it as not important.\n- **Not described**: no staff interaction about allergy is described.\n\n### Cuisine baseline risk\nSome cuisines have higher baseline likelihood of nut cross-contact due to common ingredients and preparation practices. When cuisine is known, treat baseline risk as higher for cuisines commonly using peanuts/tree nuts and shared sauces/oils (e.g., Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese/Asian, etc.), and lower for cuisines where nut exposure is less central (e.g., many American/Italian/pizza contexts). When multiple cuisines apply, use the higher-risk baseline.\n\n### Recency principle\nMore recent incidents should weigh more heavily than older incidents. However, severe incidents remain important even if older.\n\n## Final verdict rules (Low / High / Critical)\n\n**Critical Risk** if any of the following is true:\n- A single severe firsthand incident is reported.\n- A firsthand incident is reported after an explicit assurance of safety, and the incident is described as moderate-or-severe or medically significant.\n- Multiple firsthand incidents indicate an ongoing pattern (e.g., repeated moderate incidents, or repeated incidents with dismissive/refusal behavior).\n\n**High Risk** if Critical Risk does not apply, but any of the following is true:\n- At least one moderate firsthand incident is reported (especially if recent).\n- A firsthand incident occurs after an explicit assurance of safety, even if symptoms are described as mild (because the assurance represents a process failure).\n- Reviews repeatedly describe staff as refusing or being dismissive about allergy concerns.\n- Baseline cuisine risk is high and evidence suggests inconsistent allergy handling.\n\n**Low Risk** otherwise, especially when:\n- no firsthand incidents are reported, and\n- allergy-relevant reviews describe consistent accommodation behavior or careful handling.\n\n## Confidence note (must be reported with verdict)\nAlongside the verdict, report whether the decision is based on limited evidence (very few allergy-relevant reviews) or substantial evidence (many allergy-relevant reviews). This is not the risk level itself, but an indicator of how stable the conclusion is.\n\n\n---\n\n# Task\n\nAnalyze the following reviews for **Sweet Freedom Bakery** (Gluten-Free, Food, Bakeries, Restaurants, Vegan) and provide an Allergy Safety Risk Assessment.\n\n## Reviews\n\n**Review 1** (Rating: 5.0/5, Date: 2019-10-30 17:49:28):\nI had an amazingly good first experience with Sweet Freedom.  I spoke to a very pleasant lady on the phone who put aside 6 vanilla cupcakes for my vegan teen's birthday.\n\nWhen I came to pick them up they were boxed and ready.   I also wound up getting 6 more cupcakes in assorted flavors, chocolate, salted caramel and triple berry.\n\nMy kid loved them and shared with her friends.\n\nGood vegan desserts are a blessing.\n\nThanks, sweet freedom, for supporting our animal-free diet.\n\n**Review 2** (Rating: 1.0/5, Date: 2019-10-18 17:23:14):\nI truly wanted to love this bakery. With so many food allergies in our group, this was the only bakery that could cater to our needs. This is where the good ends. From the beginning working with this company was a nightmare. This nightmare only got worse when we received the cake. The picture below truly does not do it justice. It was rushed, crooked, barely legible, AND THEY COULDNT EVEN SPELL BIRTHDAY CORRECTLY. Not to mention inedible. For $77 this is unbelievably appalling. After more than 5 calls to them to attempt to rectify this situation, I am STILL waiting for a call from the manager who I was told would call me back within minutes. This was a week ago. We were holding off on this review in attempt to wait for them to do SOMETHING to fix this disaster they created. If I could leave negative stars, I would.\n\n**Review 3** (Rating: 1.0/5, Date: 2019-09-15 01:10:48):\nThis is a $77 cake. Out of 8 people, this is all we could choke down. While the customer service was good, the product was not. Not worth it.\n\n**Review 4** (Rating: 5.0/5, Date: 2019-08-22 22:44:33):\nI was recently at Sweet Freedom and had a really exceptional and positive experience with my kid who has multiple food allergies.  Even though I have no food allergies and can eat anything, I prefer the taste of Sweet Freedom baked goods.  I find them moist and filling and there is something about the texture that is unusually rich and delicious to my palette.  The chocolate frosting that i usually get on our goods is always rich.  I had a negative customer service on one occasion that I went there but it hasn't repeated itself and I'm glad I returned.  (Everyone has a bad day once in awhile, so I am letting that one experience go.  And my kid still enjoyed herself that day, so it really was fine.) Personally speaking I also love the decor and think it's perfect and artsy for a genuine \"get-away\" for kids and families who can't eat traditional pastries due to food allergies or medical needs.  We also go to Sweet Freedom for the birthday cake; it's high for our budget but our kid loves it and it's delicious (and safe!!) so we return.  There's a really nice selection of cupcakes and cookies.  It's a real treat for us when we go.\n\n**Review 5** (Rating: 4.0/5, Date: 2019-07-08 00:42:55):\nI have stopped by here recently. My favorite was the magic bar, hands down, absolutely delicious. I sadly didn't love the cinnamon donuts or loafs. They can cater to a variety of allergies (gluten, dairy). I think the baked goods are too expensive.\n\n**Review 6** (Rating: 5.0/5, Date: 2019-07-07 19:48:51):\nThis place is amazing!!!! Everything is gluten free, dairy free, soy free and corn free (and some other allergens but these are the ones that matter to me!). Being gluten and dairy free? It's hard to find cupcakes that aren't dry. These were so soft and moist. My husband and I shared the s'more (graham cracker crust, chocolate cupcake with a divine coconut cream based \"marshmallow\"), chocolate dipped raspberry (chocolate cupcake with a ganache like frosting filled with raspberry, and my husband got the French toast stuffed with strawberry. To go we got blueberry muffins, a chocolate donut and some cookies. I found the prices to be VERY fair when compared to a gluten free/vegan bakery where I'm from. I HIGHLY recommend.\n\n**Review 7** (Rating: 2.0/5, Date: 2019-07-03 21:44:32):\nOrdered a strawberry shortcake for my special gals bday a week in advance. Asked specifically for a \"naked\" style... the girl who took my order seemed so uninterested and unenthused. I went over with her two times what I was looking for. Well, $60 later, I picked up a birthday cake that was NOT cold, iced to the MAX, and had a huge hole on the side with all the filling pouring out. I called as soon as I got to my car and the same girl (I'm assuming their only help) didn't share a bit of concern. \"Well is there something you want me to do for you right now? We close in an hour\" I was so mad that I hung up.. I'm so upset with this bakery that I was so hopeful for. The cake was so bad that we left it at the restaurant after the dinner. Party of 8. I was embarrassed. Thank you for not giving it your all.\n\n**Review 8** (Rating: 4.0/5, Date: 2019-06-30 00:48:19):\nHealthy gluten free bakery w tasty treat! They use natural ingredients and nothing processed!\n\n**Review 9** (Rating: 2.0/5, Date: 2019-06-04 13:09:07):\nWe were visiting from out of town and happy to find a dedicated gluten free bakery within walking distance. The service was lovely and the taste was pretty good (if overly sweet, my daughters felt), but the prices were high and all three of us felt ill after eating here. We figured it had to be something else that we ate- but we had bought extra goodies to eat at home the next day, and all ended up feeling ill the second time as well. Too much of a coincidence for me. As a celiac with a daughter who also has celiac, we try to support gluten free businesses whenever we can. Unfortunately we wouldn't visit this bakery again.\n\n**Review 10** (Rating: 4.0/5, Date: 2019-06-01 15:15:21):\nWhat a great resource - especially for those of us contending with food allergies. Sweet Freedom is a creative, clean and super friendly bakery right in Center City. I personally recommend the Fauxstess cupcakes and the chocolate glazed donuts!\n\n**Review 11** (Rating: 4.0/5, Date: 2019-05-30 01:35:19):\nI only had a Boston creme cupcake and a doughnut from this place.  In the world of gluten and lactose intolerance, pretty damn good.\n\nMake a day of it:  hang out at the Philadelphia Magic Gardens then walk down the street to Sweet Freedom.  \n\nOr don't.  Do what you want.  No one's stopping you.  Jerk.\n\n**Review 12** (Rating: 5.0/5, Date: 2019-05-08 23:38:13):\nI got a chocolate cupcake and a magic bar and both were delicious. It's not easy baking without refined sugar and gluten and I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty these treats were. I look forward to trying more desserts.\n\n**Review 13** (Rating: 5.0/5, Date: 2019-05-05 21:37:12):\nAll of the cookies are great. Taste like normal cookies. There are plenty of chocolate chips to give sweetness to the cookies. The banana chocolate chip cookie has delicious banana taste. \n\nThe blueberry crumb bars are awesome. Very moist with perfect sweetness, melts in your mouth.\n\nChocolate chip banana bread is great. Moist and sweet.\n\nThe s'mores cupcakes is awesome. It has pretty thick graham cracker crust, moist chocolate cake and creamy frosting.\n\nThe brownies are sweet and moist. Highly recommend.\n\nDon't forget to check out on the side next to the register the baked donuts, muffins, and gluten free tomato pie. The donut is very dense but still sweet and delicious. \n\nI enjoyed everything there.\n\n**Review 14** (Rating: 3.0/5, Date: 2019-04-26 22:15:13):\nFirst of all, it is amazing to have a bakery that is safe for the top 9 anaphylactic food allergies; so many children don't get to regularly have sweets.  Sweet Freedom is a WONDERFUL option.  It is not a typical bakery; it is made for people with dietary and medical food restrictions, most of them kids.  Despite the restrictions, unlike some other reviewers, I still find the baked good delicious (though small and pricey.)  We have also ordered their birthday cake in the past.  However: I'm writing this critical review because I want to see Sweet Freedom to succeed.  I was recently at the Bryn Mawr location and treated very rudely by the young person at the register, who I believe may have been one of the pastry chefs.  I don't know, and I don't want to get any one person in trouble. I do hope they get this message and change their attitude here on out.  Sweet Freedom is not close to me; it is a hike to come to you.  I am a freelancer, and Sweet Freedom is expensive for me.  My child has been to the ER for anaphylaxis; we take their safety and cross-contamination very seriously.  These three factors make trips to Sweet Freedom extremely rare, costly, and special.  This young person came very close to ruining what is a major event in my life:  to treat my child to specialty items they can't easily get.  I have worked in customer service for decades, and I know firsthand there is never an excuse for rudeness or a condescending attitude.  This person's unsolicited hostility and entitlement were upsetting to me.  I do not know the next time I will willingly return.  The bakery itself is delightful; though costly, the sweets are moist, inventive, delicious, and best of all safe.  I enjoy the atmosphere as well.  However, no business can endure with rude customer service.  In past years I worked in many stores in the same location as your bakery, and I full well know the spectrum of what is acceptable and civil versus what is downright rude.  This person was awful.\n\n**Review 15** (Rating: 1.0/5, Date: 2019-04-20 16:15:37):\nHorrible, picked up half a dozen and each one tasted like chalk. $4 a cupcake?! They should be ashamed of themselves.\n\n**Review 16** (Rating: 5.0/5, Date: 2019-04-16 17:27:35):\nI am very, very surprised to see so many negative reviews for this business. I stopped by Sweet Freedom this morning, to pick up a treat. I'm gluten free and always disappointed when GF options are also vegan, because I love butter and milk and other distinctly non-vegan ingredients as much as anyone, possibly more. I had low expectations at Sweet Freedom, but I was delighted and surprised at how delicious their baked goods are. \n\nMy friend got the banana chocolate chip cookie and took a little bite of it as we were leaving. It was so delicious she turned around and promptly bought another. I bought the magic bar for myself and it was really good. A little bit dry, but that's to be expected sometimes with modified treats. It was still very fulfilling and a delicious treat. \n\nOne thing that really surprised me was the prices. They were much lower than they often are at specialty bakeries. The cookies and cookie bars were about $2 each which I think is a great price. I've seen similar products sold for $3-4 often. \n\nI don't live locally so I won't be able to return often, but I highly recommend for those who are in the area or who are passing through and have dietary restrictions.\n\n**Review 17** (Rating: 5.0/5, Date: 2019-04-14 18:37:30):\nI LOVE THIS PLACE Best sweets without feeling guilty and applies to ALL of my restrictions!! SOO tasty!!\n\n**Review 18** (Rating: 4.0/5, Date: 2019-03-21 20:42:49):\nAlthough I had a bad experience last time at this bakery due to the rude middle age ladies and awful dry, bready carrot cake, this time was much better. A nice, friendly young man helped me and was super knowledgeable about the menu. He knew all the prices and could answer any question about all of the items. I ordered a chocolate chip cookie, a magic bar, and a Samoa cupcake.\n\nI wouldn't recommend the chocolate chip cookie because it wasn't very good. It wasn't sweet and not sure how to describe the cookie besides \"blah\". \n\nThe Samoa Cupcake was AMAZING! The cake texture was moist, not dense like most gluten-free cakes. The caramel and chocolate drizzle was perfect and complemented the slightly sweet vanilla cake. \n\nThe Magic Bar was also SO SO GOOD. Highly recommend! The cookie was super delicious and moist with a thick chocolate layer that almost tasted like a chocolate chip coconut cookie but so much better.\n\n**Review 19** (Rating: 2.0/5, Date: 2019-02-23 19:05:26):\nWe stopped here while visiting Philadelphia from Northern Virginia because I was super stoked to be getting baked goods from a gluten free bakery. In fact, it was the very first stop when we came into the city. Parking can be tricky (street parking and it's hit or miss). \n\nThe restaurant itself is clean with limited indoor seating available. Their expensive for what you get. We ordered a cupcake and some sort of berry oat dessert. Both tasted extremely dry. In fact, I didn't even finish either of them. Total disappointment. I give them props for having GF options and several baked good options available. Their location is in a trendy little building, and their service was good. Otherwise, I wasn't impressed.\n\n**Review 20** (Rating: 5.0/5, Date: 2018-12-20 20:11:57):\nI never imagined I'd be able to find a dessert I could eat out, since it is nearly impossible, no matter what city I am in. \n\nMy restrictions are similar to paleo, but I can eat white rice that is included in some of the items. No chocolate (or multiple other things). If you are in a similar situation, just watch out for the baked goods made with garbanzo flour. All ingredients are listed on their website (super helpful!) so check it out before you order. See the indoor photos for a list of the ingredients never used (soy, corn, gluten, dairy, etc.).\n\nThere were multiple items I could choose from. I went with the vanilla cupcake, and it was heavenly!!! I cannot even remember the last time I ate \"real\" frosting. They were sweet and filling. There was a high-quality, healthy taste to them that made you feel like you weren't just eating junk. I bought a second one for the next day and am glad I did.\n\nI noticed there are some negative reviews for this place. The space isn't gorgeous but is bakery-like. The worker wasn't extremely friendly. My friends that didn't have restrictions said they enjoyed their choices, but I'm sure it all tastes even better to someone who can't eat wherever they want. It just doesn't work to compare [almost]paleo desserts to regular desserts.\n\n**Review 21** (Rating: 3.0/5, Date: 2018-12-09 00:34:58):\nI don't know friends. I feel kind of horrible saying bad things about a place. It's not like me. I think I gave this place a good shot though. I got a variety of things on 3 different occasions. First, I need to say something that a lot of reviews about this place doesn't say. The service is great. I have never had a problem with service. I've always had a smiling, patient and kind person helping me. No complaints there at all!\n\nMy issue with this place is the food items. On visit number 1 I got a cookie and a cranberry crumble bar type thing. The cranberry thing was really really sweet, had a ton of flavor and was really yummy. I'm not complaining about it at all! The cookie on the other hand (chocolate chip) was kind of bland and had a strange aftertaste. I ate it anyway thinking maybe it was from yesterday and not everything can be amazing. \n\nVisit number 2 was a second kind of cookie, I went with the chocolate chocolate chip (or double chocolate - I forget the name) and an apple cider donut. The cookie tasted exactly the same as the first so I thought..ok maybe it's just the cookies. Moving on! But then the donut had the same kind of strange aftertaste. I noticed that the outside of the donut was good because it was basically just sugar and cinnamon, but the consistency of the donut was dry and again that aftertaste that I just can't put my finger on...\n\nVisit number 3. I went with a mint chocolate brownie and a different type of donut. The person who helped me said that she thought it was a jelly filled donut, but she wasn't certain. I was seriously craving that brownie so a few steps out of the store I took a big bite of it. The flavors were mostly there. A nice bite of chocolate and a hint of mint, but the brownie was kind of dry and crumbly and again that aftertaste was lurking. It wasn't so strong this time, but I definitely got it. I waited until the next day with the donut thinking it would still be fine since it was sealed in plastic wrap. Instead of biting into it I decided to rip it in half so I could get to that sweet sweet jelly filling. I was instantly disappointed when I was greeted with what looked like a thick white pasty cream. Boston cream maybe? Not at all. I took a bite of the inside with the donut and the frosting on top thinking I should give this donut all I had and just go for it. Hard no. I actually spit it out and threw the rest away. The cream in the middle and the frosting on top were basically just thick creamy sugar with no flavor and the donut had that aftertaste thing going on times 1,000. \n\nI tried and then I tried and I tried again. I'm sorry Sweet Freedom. My gluten free sweet tooth had high hopes, but you just couldn't deliver. Let me know when you start using different recipes and I'd be happy to be your taste tester once again.\n\n**Review 22** (Rating: 3.0/5, Date: 2018-10-27 15:32:53):\nNot what it use to be\n\nI remember going here about two years back at this same location and was totally impressed with the flavor of the cupcakes and other things I bought. Well this time the cupcakes were grainy/gritty like and the icing was overly sweet. I was so excited to try the carrot cupcake and was so disappointed. The variety looked for the holiday like cheaply done cupcakes with a ton of frosting so I should've known. I have been on a gluten free diet for years and know what good taste is and this place didn't meet the expectations of what they served years ago. I hope it's better if I ever go again.\n\n**Review 23** (Rating: 5.0/5, Date: 2018-10-07 22:55:34):\nFive stars because after an exhaustive search for a cupcake place to accommodate two vegan co-workers I finally was able to find this place.  First I asked about cupcakes at a bakery in town but they said I had to order like a dozen, no way!  There was a wide variety of different flavors and the prices were comparable to any other cupcake place.\n\n**Review 24** (Rating: 4.0/5, Date: 2018-09-26 12:13:05):\nIf you have crazy allergies this is the place to be. I admit, I have celiac and dairy intolerance so I was pumped for this place. It's quite pricey and they don't use any preservatives so make sure you eat whatever you get quickly-learn from my mistake. If you're just gluten free and want something close to a real brownie, this isn't the place for you. But if you want vegan, dairy free, etc. then go here. It's not bad if you have all these restrictions\n\n**Review 25** (Rating: 1.0/5, Date: 2018-09-04 23:17:37):\nI dropped by here today to get me some birthday cupcake since it is my birthday today. I was excited since being a vegan its hard to find vegan treats but I was sadly disappointed.  The cupcakes were flavorless and that included the icing. I actually had day old donuts from Govinda's and it they were delicious. Im sorry Sweet Freedom, its a no for me.\n\n**Review 26** (Rating: 1.0/5, Date: 2018-08-22 01:25:28):\nWas in the area and wanted to grab some vegan donuts (and were prepared to take home at least a dozen...we live almost 2.5 hrs away).  First bummer, only two donut flavors.  Ok, so we don't need to bring home a dozen.  Secondly, from the description we weren't quite sure if SFB had gf donuts AND vegan donuts or made a gf-vegan donut combination.  It was the latter.  Not to be deterred, we purchased a single donut...for $3.75.  It was anything but a donut.  It was more cake-like, but not in a good cake-style donut way.  It was dry.  It crumbled into bits.  It sucked the saliva from our mouths.  It was a hot mess, and it was tossed in the rubbish for some unsuspecting squirrel or raccoon to decide if it is worth consuming.  I cannot speak to gf donuts, but for anyone who wants a phenomenal vegan donut...if you're in Manhattan or Brooklyn, run to Dunwell donuts.  You'll plow through three of them before you take a breath.  If you're in the Baltimore area, Donut Alliance is pretty respectable.\n\n**Review 27** (Rating: 4.0/5, Date: 2018-06-24 22:24:33):\nI'm not quite sure why there are mixed reviews on this bakery. I stopped by during on my work trip and saw that had an extensive variety of cupcakes and brownies. \n\nI had a Samoa Brownie with coconut shavings on top and a Little Hostess chocolate cupcake. They both seemed a little dry, but you have to take into consideration these are gluten free AND vegan, which is a hard combination to make... But they did a decent job.\n\n**Review 28** (Rating: 1.0/5, Date: 2018-06-11 01:46:40):\nSweet Freedom Bakery deserves one star because the staff is very nice. That said, we don't put 'very nice' into our mouths like we do (though we may wish we didn't have to) their cakes. We ordered our daughters graduation cake from Sweet Freedom at a price that exceeds any cake I have bought (I have three daughters with lots of birthdays and graduations). When my husband went to pick it up on foot (city bakery, city clients, walking not driving) they handed him a box, told him to hurry home because it was hot, yet had no string and handle to assist in the process (which is considered normal bakery ware). Once it was time to celebrate with a delicious sweet, we were beyond disappointed. The cake, though it looked nice, was inedible, by dairy eaters and vegans alike. I will never purchase what \"should be\" delicious from Sweet Freedom Bakery again...and I advise you to follow suit.\n\n**Review 29** (Rating: 5.0/5, Date: 2018-04-18 21:50:19):\nI absolutely love this bakery!! Their s'mores cupcake has got to be my favorite. The only thing I would say is bad is there isn't much of a selection-- but what they do have is amazing!!\n\n**Review 30** (Rating: 2.0/5, Date: 2018-04-05 22:10:35):\nMy husband bought me a small box with a variety of sweets from this bakery for my birthday. They honestly were not good (i took a bite of each and did not finish any), especially for the price.\n\n**Review 31** (Rating: 1.0/5, Date: 2018-04-03 20:36:43):\nMy mom ordered some vanilla cupcakes and double chocolate chip cookies for my brother's birthday from Sweet Freedom, which were shipped to us an hour away. We aren't GF/DF but occasionally we try better alternatives. We were looking forward to these all week; unfortunately, I'm not impressed. Even considering the health-oriented ingredients they use, which is a plus, the desserts just weren't good. \n\nEverything came as a kit with the icing in a small tub and the cupcakes and cookies individually shrink-wrapped. The icing had the consistency of cookie batter: grainy and crumbly, slightly dry, not approaching creamy. The icing tub was packaged in cling wrap so I don't see how it could have dried out. I understand the ingredients are different but it smelled and tasted off. Stirring it wouldn't free up the mixture. I was worried I wouldn't be able to decorate with it, but I put it in a (non-provided) piping bag anyway. The icing was so thick it burst a hole in the bag. So far, not good. I made the best of it by smearing it on. The cupcakes themselves were heavy, thick, dry, and largely tasteless. The cookies were okay. They were soft and had a great texture, but the finishing taste was strangely salty. I felt sorry these were my brother's birthday dessert. For 6 bad cupcakes and 12 adequate cookies, my mom paid around $40.\n\nI like what they're trying to do by making healthier desserts. I imagine it's harder to create a delicious, airy dessert with the ingredients that must be used in lieu of conventional ingredients, but I believe it can be done. I'm just not seeing it here. From our experience I don't recommend people buy their shipped products.\n\n**Review 32** (Rating: 2.0/5, Date: 2018-04-01 02:57:45):\nI love the idea of this bakery trying to tailor its baked goods to people who cannot normally enjoy baked goods due to dietary restrictions. However, I don't know how I feel about this bakery with regards to the price, taste, and the two owners. \n\nI ordered a 6-inch carrot cake with vanilla frosting from here that cost $50, which is the standard cost for all 6' cakes. This is pricey for such a small cake. The \"Happy 20th Birthday\" writing was underwhelmingly plain and I expected a very impressive design for that much money or at least to include my name on the cake. \n\nThe ladies who run the store were not very welcoming either. It didn't seem like they wanted to be there. The taste and texture of the cake make up a bit for the price and poor service. Like most gluten-free cakes, the cake was very dense. The carrot cake was a bit dry but it's probably because it's healthier and uses less oil than most cakes. I love how the cake had nice shreds of carrots and coconut but I wish there were walnuts and raisins throughout as well. The vanilla frosting was thick and creamy, which I prefer to light, whipped icings that have a whipped cream consistency. It was a bit too sweet though. \n\nOverall, I do not think the medicore cake was worth the price and will not be coming back here. I am glad that I gave this place a try though.\n\n**Review 33** (Rating: 5.0/5, Date: 2018-03-16 18:47:55):\nI got a chocolate cupcake and a magic bar and both were delicious. It's not easy baking without refined sugar and gluten and I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty these treats were. I look forward to trying more desserts.\n\n**Review 34** (Rating: 4.0/5, Date: 2018-03-01 20:50:08):\nOkay. Take this one with a grain of salt: people who eat here eat here because they can't eat at other places. Of course, a gluten free vegan brownie is not going to taste and feel like a regular, traditional brownie. I'm past that point and understand expectations.\nWhen you look at the list of allergens they omit in the recipies, it's kind of amazing. I've been in various states of dietary restrictions over the years, and most every time I could eat here because they cut out so much.\nSome of the products are better than others - I'm not a fan of the muffins, their birthday cakes tend to be grainy and on the dry side - but some, like the brownies and the bars and the cake pop things, are really tasty.\nService-wise, they tend to run out of certain things quickly, and depending on who's behind the counter it's hard to even call ahead and ask if what you want is there. They do take orders.\nThey're not my favorite gluten free bakery, but they are the one I have to ask the fewest questions about. That alone is worth a visit if you're in the \"I can't eat this\" club.\n\n**Review 35** (Rating: 4.0/5, Date: 2018-01-22 17:36:57):\n*UPDATE\nWent back again... all the lights were on, the smell of warm baking was welcoming and the chocolate chip cookie was AMAZING. Still not fully sold on the cupcakes, but the cookie is worth coming back for.\n\nI can totally understand why vegans and others with dietary restrictions would go nuts over this place! It's nice to really not have to worry about what you're ordering and they have all the ingredients listed next to each items.\n\nFor me it was ok. Honestly, we thought it was closed when we walked by at first because it looked so dark on the inside. The girl who was working really didn't greet us at all when we came in (unless you count standing at the counter and looking at us as a greeting...). I ordered the Samoa cupcake. For a cupcake with no refined sugar it was almost too sweet for me. The icing was good, the cake was really good, but there was this layer/filling that put it in the \"in the almost too sweet\" category for me. \n\nAlso, would be nice for to-go cupcakes to have a small box instead of a bag. I lost some of my icing in the bag on the way home\n\nGood to know the place is around though! And definitely somewhere I'll remember for friends with dietary restrictions.\n\n**Review 36** (Rating: 3.0/5, Date: 2018-01-14 23:03:54):\nI can totally understand why vegans and others with dietary restrictions would go nuts over this place!

It was the absolute worse cake and service I have ever had. I am a strict and long time vegan and my usual go to bakery for cakes was booked for the holiday. I chose this bakery because I thought it was reasonable priced for a last minute order (I ordered about a week or so before Christmas!),  which was $150 for a double layer half sheet cake. I picked it up on Christmas eve for my Christmas party the next day. It was wrapped in plastic wrap like what most bakeries do however it didn't help this cake. I can not tell you how embarrassed I was to serve such a cake. It was rock hard!  Furthermore,  I ordered  a lemon  cake with raspberry filling and all you could taste was frosting.  The cake base tasted like dirt. Literally measly with no flavor.. Not a lemon flavor in sight. It was the absolute worst cake I have ever had. I called the next day and received no help. I was only able to get the owner's name and email. Smdh  I sent her email detailing my issues and she never responded. I have called several times since then and no one has addressed my issue.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!  I was able to speak with the acting manager of the South Philly store and he apologized and said that cakes can become very hard due to the alternative flours and methods they use. But never returned my call after he were to refer to the owner. I have video of my holiday party and I also plan to report the to the BBB. If you're looking for great vegan cakes try Crust bakery or the bakery Govinda's uses because freedom bakery is horrible.\n\n**Review 38** (Rating: 5.0/5, Date: 2017-10-11 23:12:24):\nTotally Amazing!\n\nIt is hard to find desserts, sweets, etc. that are gluten-corn free that are still tasty. Most gluten-corn free desserts tastes like a cardboard box, but this place was amazing. I went there on my birthday and the lady who was working behind the counter overheard my wife saying that and she gave me a free brownie. We bought the recipe book they sell. If you are gluten intolerant check out this place and treat yourself to some delicious pastries.\n\n**Review 39** (Rating: 1.0/5, Date: 2017-08-31 21:52:03):\nI pop in here sometimes to treat myself to a cookie sandwich and, generally, the staff has been professional. This afternoon, however, I stopped in and asked for a cookie sandwich. After I asked for a cookie sandwich combo that wasn't already made (there were only two options in the display), the person working the counter rudely asked if I wanted her to make it. I've been in here plenty of times when staff volunteered to make a cookie sandwich combo that wasn't already made, so I think this is something they normally do. I said yes. She took my money, then walked to the back. When she returned, she made the sandwich with her bare hands. I was a little distracted and needed to get home, so I didn't think too much about it at the time. I thought that maybe she washed her hands in the back. On my way home though, I started thinking about it and really don't think she had time to wash her hands. In hindsight, I should have said something at the time, but I needed to get home and there was someone trying to pick up an order. Cannot eat the sandwich! Who knows what else she touched before the cookies - at a minimum, the cash I paid for the cookie sandwich. After the attitude and cleanliness concern, I won't be back here.\n\n**Review 40** (Rating: 2.0/5, Date: 2017-08-31 15:27:59):\nThe shop is straightforward and simple, and the cupcake I got was good, but I was signed up for their mailing list without my permission or knowledge. Next time I'm at the Kimmel Center, I will get a treat somewhere less likely to clutter my inbox.\n\n**Review 41** (Rating: 2.0/5, Date: 2017-08-16 20:31:20):\nThis was a cute bakery that did have all the restrictions covered.. but my magic bar was very dry and felt more like a dry protein bar than a yummy dessert, maybe I should have gone with a cupcake or something..\n\n**Review 42** (Rating: 4.0/5, Date: 2017-08-16 00:05:02):\nA good place for those of us with food sensitivities. Some items are significantly better than others, though. Donuts are a highlight and the challah bread is excellent (makes tasty French toast). \n\nDon't expect too many choices if you go later in the afternoon, as items begin to run out. \n\nService varies depending on employee. Some are great, some mediocre.\n\n**Review 43** (Rating: 1.0/5, Date: 2017-08-10 22:04:10):\nAs with most of my 1 star reviews, this is based solely on service.\n\nIt was trouble from that get go. First of all the place had an odd odor but I honestly assumed it had something to with the fact it was gluten-free, I have no knowledge on how those bake goods should smell like lol. So I let it go.\n\nMy second issue was the women at the counter was super rude, and disrespectful. We came in and began to look at the pastries and she just stared at us. She never said hello, didn't smile, literally no recognition of our presence aside from a side eye.\u00a0\n\nI was like ugh.. ok. But instead of treating her with the disrespect we were met with I pepped up and said \" Hello, how are you doing? Do you have any recommendations? She perked up a fraction and very dully explained what was left of popular items.\n\nI ended up ordering a chocolate cupcake and my friend ordered some cookies for herself and her grandmother. We paid and left. I was so distracted by the smell and bad service I didn't even realize that the place was also vegan and bit into literally the most disgusting cupcake I have ever eaten, ever.... This was also the case with the cookies we were collectively spitting out the window.\n\n**Review 44** (Rating: 2.0/5, Date: 2017-07-24 12:50:10):\nAfter reading the reviews my exceptions were very high! I can NEVER find gluten free donuts so I was SO excited. No problem with service just with the taste. I got a cookie and a donut type product. The donut was very dry and hard to swallow with no chocolate taste. The cookie was mushy with very little taste. SO UPSETTING.\n\n**Review 45** (Rating: 5.0/5, Date: 2017-06-21 04:05:46):\nI'm free I'm free! I love chocolate cake without egg. Was treated to Sweet freedom for my birthday and will definitely be returning.\n\n**Review 46** (Rating: 5.0/5, Date: 2017-06-15 04:56:57):\nMy boyfriend surprised me with a birthday cake from here. I wasn't even aware that we had any vegan bakeries near us. The cake was absolutely delicious, and everyone loved it... even non-vegans.\n\n**Review 47** (Rating: 5.0/5, Date: 2017-05-18 02:35:39):\nAs someone who has a whole list of dietary restrictions (gluten-free, vegan, & soy-free, to name a few...), this place was just a God-send for me! I bought a box of some of their baked goods while visiting Philly and was not disappointed. Really wish there was one of these bakeries back home in Florida!\n\n**Review 48** (Rating: 3.0/5, Date: 2017-04-26 12:05:00):\nI really want to love sweet freedom since I love the concept but a few things hold it back - poor customer service every time I've been, and really hit or miss desserts. \n\nThe magic bars are amazing and a few of their cake balls are quite good, but I've been disappointed by their gritty and too sweet brownies, their strangely plasticky tasting frosting for being all natural in their cookie sandwiches, and bitter or overcooked cookies. It's not that hard to bake delicious desserts with their limits - clearly sometimes they land. It wouldn't be such a disappointment either if the folks behind the counter even tried to be friendly.\n\n**Review 49** (Rating: 5.0/5, Date: 2017-04-06 00:11:58):\nI love, love, love this place! Their salted caramel cupcakes and magic bars are beyond fabulous! I usually try to steer clear of gluten only because it is bad news and I bake, too...but when I need a break, this is where I turn...the coconut cream icings- omg...and if you can ever catch a lemon cupcake, grab it!\n\n**Review 50** (Rating: 5.0/5, Date: 2017-03-10 18:02:26):\nGot my wedding cake here this time last year and several spur of the moment treats before we moved out of state. Their stuff is AMAZING. Yes, not cheap, but its definitely specialty and they care about their ingredients. The taste will not disappoint, and, as someone with Celiac, I feel safe eating their stuff which is invaluable in a wheat-filled world. Customer service was great, variety was great. I miss this place so much and hope it grows!\n\n---\n\n# Instructions\n\n1. First, identify all allergy-relevant reviews from the set above (cite by review number).\n2.

Baseline risk for cross-contact in dedicated GF/vegan shops is typically lower than a generic restaurant, but not zero. Given the recurring mentions of gluten-free, dairy-free, and other allergen restrictions, plus occasional missteps described in staff, the baseline risk can be considered Low-to-Medium. For a conservative assessment with mixed signals, we treat the cuisine baseline as Medium when evaluating risk signals across reviews.\n\n4) Final verdict (apply the Allergy Safety Risk rules)\n- Critical Risk: Not met. There is no single severe firsthand incident described, and no explicit post-assurance severe incident.\n- High Risk: Met. There are multiple firsthand allergy-related incidents and concerns:\n  - Two clear first-hand illness incidents after consumption (Reviews 9 and 19), which are nontrivial when the venue is a GF/vegan bakery expected to minimize such risk.\n  - Repeated mentions of staff behavior and handling concerns (e.g., Review 39, Review 14 noting rude/less careful handling) that point to inconsistent allergy handling.\n  - The combination of illness incidents and symptomatic staff handling concerns, even with many positive safety assertions, suggests a pattern of risk rather than a consistently safe environment.\n- Low Risk: Not applicable given the above pattern.\n\nConclusion: High Risk\n\n5) Confidence level\n- Based on substantial evidence: multiple firsthand allergy-relevant reviews (illness after consumption in two separate reviews; repeated staff concerns; plus several reviews emphasizing accommodations or safety but with ongoing safety questions). This is more than a handful of data points, so the conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.\n\nFinal verdict: High Risk\nConfidence: Substantial evidence\n\nNotes\n- The presence of many reviews celebrating accommodations and safe options indicates awareness of allergen needs, but the recurring illness reports and staff-related concerns indicate gaps in consistently safe handling. The pattern warrants caution for patrons with severe allergies. If you\u2019re advising a consumer, you might suggest verifying current safety practices in person (e.g., ask about cross-contact procedures, dedicated equipment, and ingredient lists on site) and considering alternative GF/vegan options with more consistently documented safety procedures.",
