When attempting to avoid it during Restaurant Week, staff told them not to even ask the chef about accommodations.\n  - Incident type: Allergy accommodation discussion (firsthand)\n  - Incident severity: No reaction described (no allergic reaction occurred in this account)\n  - Staff response: Dismissive (staff claimed not to pass requests to the chef)\n  - Assurance of safety: None\n  - High-risk cuisine: No (Bliss is American; not Thai/Vietnamese/Chinese)\n  - Points: 0 for severity + 3 for staff dismissiveness = 3 points\n\nOther reviews with allergy references exist, but none clearly meet the criteria for a confirmed firsthand incident with explicit reaction or explicit safety assurance beyond this one instance. Some reviews mention gluten-free accommodations (e.g., Kristin in 2010 discussing a client with celiac) but are secondhand reports and do not constitute a firsthand incident per the scoring rules.\n\nTotal risk score: 3 points\nVerdict: Low Risk\n\nNotes\n- The main antioxidant here is a single firsthand incident where an allergy concern was not accommodated promptly (dismissive staff). Since there was no actual allergic reaction described, the severity contributes 0 points, leaving the overall score at 3.\n- No evidence in the provided reviews indicates guaranteed allergen-free preparation or explicit safety assurances from Bliss staff. If more firsthand accounts with reactions or clear assurances appeared, the risk score could increase.",
