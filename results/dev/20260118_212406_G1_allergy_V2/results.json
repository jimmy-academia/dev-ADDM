      "response": "Risk label: Low Risk\n\nRationale:\n- Only one firsthand incident relevant to allergy safety was found in the reviews: Kristin\u2019s 2010 account describing a gluten-free accommodation for a client with celiac disease.\n- Incident severity: No allergic reaction occurred (No reaction).\n- Staff response: The server initially did not have answers, but the kitchen eventually accommodated and the client\u2019s gluten-free requests were satisfied.\n- Assurance of safety: No explicit safety guarantees or assurances were stated.\n- Cuisine risk modifier: Not a high-risk cuisine (American/Thai fusion style noted in other reviews, but not Thai/Vietnamese/Chinese as a core cuisine).\n- Scoring: Severity is No reaction (0 points). No false assurance (+5), no dismissive staff (+3), and no high-risk cuisine (+2). Total score = 0.\n\nEvidence (from review):\n- \u201cMy client is a celiac and can't eat gluten/wheat.\u201d\n- \u201cThe waiter... didn\u2019t seem to have answers (for gluten-free options), we had to tell him to go ask.\u201d\n- \u201cThe kitchen did get her requests correct and the item was gluten-free.\u201d\n\nConclusion: With a total score of 0, the restaurant falls into Low Risk.",
