# Execution Quality Assessment

Help assess how well this restaurant executes orders and keeps promises using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner diagnosing operational issues.
Assign a label: Needs Improvement, Satisfactory, or Excellent.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system with recency weighting.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- order accuracy (correct items, modifications)
- promises made and kept
- how issues were resolved
- menu accuracy and descriptions

Reviews that only discuss ambiance without mentioning order execution carry less weight.

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Order Accuracy
Whether orders were fulfilled correctly

- **Perfect**: Everything correct, no issues
- **Minor Error**: Small mistake, easily fixed
- **Significant Error**: Major order problem
- **Multiple Errors**: Several mistakes on single order

### Modification Handling
How well they handled special requests

- **Refused**: Would not accommodate modification
- **Ignored**: Modification request was ignored
- **Attempted**: Tried but got it wrong
- **Successful**: Modification handled correctly

### Promise Kept
Whether stated commitments were honored

- **Broken**: Promise was not kept
- **Partial**: Promise partially fulfilled
- **Kept**: Promise was fulfilled

### Issue Resolution
How well problems were resolved

- **None**: Issue not addressed
- **Poor**: Attempted but inadequate resolution
- **Adequate**: Acceptable resolution
- **Excellent**: Went above and beyond to fix


## Scoring System

Calculate an execution score by summing points from relevant reviews,
with recency weighting. Execution processes can improve or degrade,
so recent reviews are weighted more heavily.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Perfect execution: 10 points
- Good execution: 5 points
- Adequate execution: 0 points
- Minor execution error: -2 points
- Significant execution error: -5 points
- Complete failure: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- Above and beyond resolution (issue resolved exceptionally): +5 points
- Modifications handled perfectly (special requests always correct): +3 points
- Modification ignored (special request not honored): -5 points
- No resolution attempt (issue not addressed): -5 points

Recency weighting:
- Within 6 months: full point value
- 6 months to 1 year: three-quarter point value (multiply by 0.75)
- 1-2 years old: half point value (multiply by 0.5)
- Over 2 years old: quarter point value (multiply by 0.25) - processes likely changed


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Excellent** if any of the following is true:
- Total score is 8 or higher (after recency weighting)

**Needs Improvement** if Excellent does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total score is -5 or lower (after recency weighting)

**Satisfactory** otherwise, especially when:
- Total score is between -4 and 7
- Recent reviews show improvement in execution
