# Price-Worth Value Assessment

Help assess the value-for-money at this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a value label: Poor Value, Fair Value, or Good Value.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system to quantify value.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- price perception (expensive, cheap, worth it)
- portion sizes relative to price
- quality relative to price
- deals, happy hours, lunch specials
- overall value assessment

Reviews that only discuss food quality without mentioning price carry less weight.

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Price Perception
Perception of value for money

- **Ripoff**: Extremely overpriced, feel cheated
- **Overpriced**: Prices higher than expected for quality
- **Fair**: Prices appropriate for what you get
- **Good Value**: Good quality for the price
- **Steal**: Exceptional value, surprisingly affordable

### Portion Size
Assessment of portion sizes relative to price

- **Tiny**: Portions much too small for the price
- **Small**: Portions smaller than expected
- **Adequate**: Portions are appropriate
- **Generous**: Large, generous portions

### Quality For Price
Food quality relative to cost

- **Poor**: Quality far below what price suggests
- **Fair**: Quality matches price point
- **Good**: Quality exceeds price expectation
- **Excellent**: Premium quality at reasonable price

### Return Intent
Would return based on value assessment

- **Never**: Won't return due to poor value
- **Maybe**: Might return if prices improve
- **True**: Will return, acceptable value
- **Definitely**: Great value, will definitely return


## Scoring System

- Slightly overpriced: -3 points
- Significantly overpriced: -5 points
- Ripoff: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- Generous portions (portions described as large or generous): +3 points
- Quality exceeds price (food quality better than price suggests): +3 points
- Great deals available (happy hour, lunch specials, or deals praised): +2 points
- Tiny portions (portions described as too small): -3 points
- Quality below price (food quality worse than price suggests): -3 points
