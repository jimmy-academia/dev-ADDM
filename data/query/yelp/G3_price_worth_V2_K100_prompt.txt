# Price-Worth Value Assessment

Help assess the value-for-money at this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a value label: Poor Value, Fair Value, or Good Value.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- price perception (expensive, cheap, worth it)
- portion sizes relative to price
- quality relative to price
- deals, happy hours, lunch specials
- overall value assessment

Reviews that only discuss food quality without mentioning price carry less weight.

*Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Price Perception
Perception of value for money

- **ripoff**: Extremely overpriced, feel cheated
- **overpriced**: Prices higher than expected for quality
- **fair**: Prices appropriate for what you get
- **good_value**: Good quality for the price
- **steal**: Exceptional value, surprisingly affordable

### Portion Size
Assessment of portion sizes relative to price

- **tiny**: Portions much too small for the price
- **small**: Portions smaller than expected
- **adequate**: Portions are appropriate
- **generous**: Large, generous portions

### Quality For Price
Food quality relative to cost

- **poor**: Quality far below what price suggests
- **fair**: Quality matches price point
- **good**: Quality exceeds price expectation
- **excellent**: Premium quality at reasonable price

### Return Intent
Would return based on value assessment

- **never**: Won't return due to poor value
- **maybe**: Might return if prices improve
- **yes**: Will return, acceptable value
- **definitely**: Great value, will definitely return
