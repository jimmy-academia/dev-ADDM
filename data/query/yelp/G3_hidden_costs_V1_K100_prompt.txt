# Hidden Costs Risk Assessment

Reviews that only discuss food without mentioning billing carry less weight.

- **Service Charge**: Mandatory service charge added to bill
- **Auto Gratuity**: Automatic tip added to bill

### Impact Severity
Impact of hidden cost on total bill

- **Minor**: Small percentage of bill (<5%)
