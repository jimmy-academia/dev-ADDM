# Customer Loyalty Assessment

Help assess customer loyalty and retention indicators using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating customer loyalty.
Assign a label: Low Loyalty, Moderate Loyalty, or High Loyalty.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system to quantify loyalty.

## Scoring System

Calculate a loyalty score by summing points from relevant reviews.

- Will definitely return: 5 points
- Might return: 2 points
- Probably won't return: -5 points
- Never returning: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- Strong recommendation (actively tells others to go): +5 points
- Returned after issue (loyalty despite problems): +8 points
- Warns others away (actively discourages visits): -5 points
- Switched to competitor (explicitly left for alternative): -8 points
