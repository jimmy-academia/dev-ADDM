# Group Dining Suitability Assessment

Help assess how suitable this restaurant is for group dining (large parties, celebrations, family gatherings)
using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a suitability label: Not Recommended, Acceptable, or Recommended.

- large group dining, parties, celebrations, birthday dinners
- ability to accommodate large parties
- wait times for groups, reservation handling
- check splitting, group service coordination
- family-friendliness (if relevant)

Reviews from solo diners or couples carry less weight unless they comment on observed group experiences.

### Account Type

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

- **Small (4-6)**: Small group of 4-6 people

### Check Splitting
How easy it was to split the check
