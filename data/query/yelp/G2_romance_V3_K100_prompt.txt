# Romantic Dining Suitability Assessment

Help assess how suitable this restaurant is for romantic dining (dates, anniversaries, proposals)
using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a suitability label: Not Recommended, Acceptable, or Recommended.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system to quantify suitability.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- date nights, anniversaries, romantic occasions, proposals
- ambiance, lighting, noise level, privacy
- service style (rushed vs. attentive)
- overall romantic atmosphere

Reviews that only discuss food without mentioning atmosphere carry less weight.

*Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Ambiance Quality

- Neutral mention: 0 points
- Minor atmosphere issue: -2 points
- Major atmosphere issue: -5 points
- Date disaster: -15 points

Additional modifiers:
- Candlelit atmosphere (explicitly mentions candles or romantic lighting): +3 points
- Private seating (mentions privacy, secluded tables, or booths): +3 points
- Live music (romantic live music mentioned): +2 points
- Rushed service (service was rushed, couldn't linger): -3 points
- Loud music/crowd (noise prevented conversation): -5 points
