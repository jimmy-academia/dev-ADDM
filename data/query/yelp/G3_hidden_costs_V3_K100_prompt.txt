# Hidden Costs Risk Assessment

Help assess the risk of unexpected charges at this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system to quantify risk.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- unexpected charges on the bill
- mandatory service charges or auto-gratuity
- corkage fees, split fees, or other surcharges
- bill surprises or lack of price transparency
- fine print charges

Reviews that only discuss food without mentioning billing carry less weight.

*Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Cost Type
Type of hidden or unexpected cost

- **service_charge**: Mandatory service charge added to bill
- **auto_gratuity**: Automatic tip added to bill
- **corkage**: Fee for bringing own wine
- **split_fee**: Fee for splitting dishes or checks
- **other**: Other unexpected charges

### Disclosure Level
How well the hidden cost was disclosed

- **none**: Not mentioned until bill arrived
- **fine_print**: Mentioned in small print on menu
- **verbal**: Server mentioned it verbally
- **clear**: Clearly displayed or communicated

### Impact Severity
Impact of hidden cost on total bill

- **minor**: Small percentage of bill (<5%)
- **moderate**: Noticeable addition (5-15%)
- **significant**: Major impact on bill (>15%)

### Customer Reaction
Customer's reaction to the hidden cost

- **upset**: Very unhappy about undisclosed charges
- **annoyed**: Mildly annoyed but not deal-breaker
- **neutral**: Accepted the charge
- **understanding**: Understood and accepted the charge


## Scoring System

Calculate a risk score by summing points from hidden cost incidents.
Higher scores indicate greater risk of unexpected charges.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Minor hidden cost (<5% impact): 2 points
- Moderate hidden cost (5-15% impact): 5 points
- Significant hidden cost (>15% impact): 10 points

Additional modifiers:
- No disclosure (charge was not disclosed until bill arrived): +5 points
- Fine print only (charge mentioned only in small print): +3 points
- Multiple hidden charges (more than one type of hidden charge reported): +3 points
- Customer very upset (reviewer expressed strong negative reaction): +2 points


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Critical Risk** if any of the following is true:
- Total risk score is 290 or higher

**High Risk** if Critical Risk does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total risk score is 230 or higher

**Low Risk** otherwise
