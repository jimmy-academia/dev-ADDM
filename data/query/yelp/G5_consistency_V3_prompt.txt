## Definitions of Terms

- quality changes over time
- comparison to previous visits
- reliability and predictability
- repeat customer observations

Reviews from first-time visitors that don't mention consistency carry less weight.

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Quality Trend
Trend in quality over time

- **Declining**: Quality has gotten worse
- **Stable**: Quality remains consistent
- **Improving**: Quality has improved

### Visit Comparison
Current visit compared to previous

- **Much Worse**: Significantly worse than before
- **Worse**: Noticeably worse than before
- **Same**: Same quality as before
- **Better**: Better than before
- **Much Better**: Significantly improved

### Reliability

- **Unpredictable**: Never know what you'll get
- **Hit or Miss**: Sometimes good, sometimes not
- **Mostly Reliable**: Usually consistent with occasional issues
- **Always Reliable**: Consistently excellent every time

### Visit Frequency
How often reviewer has visited

- **First Visit**: First time at this restaurant
- **Few Visits**: Have been a few times

## Scoring System

Calculate a consistency score by summing points from relevant reviews,
with recency weighting. For consistency, trend over time is important,
so recency helps identify the current state.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Always excellent: 10 points
- Mostly reliable: 5 points
- Adequate consistency: 0 points
- Some inconsistency: -2 points
- Hit or miss: -5 points
- Completely unpredictable: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- Improving trend (quality getting better): +3 points
- Regular customer praise (frequent visitor praises consistency): +3 points
- Declining trend (quality getting worse): +-5 points
- Management change decline (quality dropped after ownership/management change): +-3 points

Recency weighting:
- Within 6 months: full point value
- 6 months to 1 year: three-quarter point value (multiply by 0.75)
- 1-2 years old: half point value (multiply by 0.5)
- Over 2 years old: quarter point value (multiply by 0.25) - trends may have changed


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Excellent** if any of the following is true:
- Total score is 8 or higher (after recency weighting)

**Needs Improvement** if Excellent does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total score is -5 or lower (after recency weighting)

**Satisfactory** otherwise, especially when:
- Total score is between -4 and 7
- Recent reviews show stable or improving consistency
