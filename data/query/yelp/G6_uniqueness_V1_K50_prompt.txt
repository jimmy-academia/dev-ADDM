# Uniqueness Assessment

Help assess how unique and differentiated this restaurant is using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating competitive positioning.
Assign a label: Generic, Differentiated, or Highly Unique.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- what makes the restaurant special or different
- signature dishes or unique offerings
- memorable experiences
- comparisons to other restaurants

Reviews that don't mention distinctiveness or memorability carry less weight.

*Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Unique Aspect
What aspect makes this restaurant unique

- **Food**: Unique or standout food
- **Atmosphere**: Unique ambiance or setting
- **Service**: Unique service approach
- **Concept**: Unique restaurant concept
- **Location**: Unique location or view
- **None**: Nothing particularly unique

### Differentiation Level
Degree of uniqueness

- **Generic**: Nothing differentiates from competitors
- **Somewhat Different**: Some distinguishing features
- **Unique**: Clearly unique offerings
- **One of a Kind**: Truly irreplaceable experience

### Memorability
How memorable the experience is

- **Forgettable**: Nothing memorable about it
- **Average**: Neither memorable nor forgettable
- **Memorable**: Stands out in memory
- **Unforgettable**: Truly unforgettable experience

### Signature Item
Whether a must-try signature item exists

- **True**: Has a famous must-try item
- **False**: No standout signature item


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Highly Unique** if any of the following is true:
- Reviews describe unique food with unforgettable experience [filter: unique_aspect=food, memorability=unforgettable]
- Reviews describe one-of-a-kind differentiation [filter: differentiation_level=one_of_a_kind, memorability=memorable]

**Generic** if Highly Unique does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- 14 or more reviews describe it as 'nothing special' [filter: differentiation_level=generic]
- 14 or more reviews mention no distinguishing features [filter: unique_aspect=none]
- 10 or more reviews describe it as easily confused with competitors [filter: differentiation_level=interchangeable]

**Differentiated** otherwise, especially when:
- Has some unique elements
- Memorable but not irreplaceable
- Some signature items
