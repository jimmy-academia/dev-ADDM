# Allergy Safety Risk Assessment

Help assess the allergy safety risk for this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system to quantify risk.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Only firsthand accounts are treated as confirmed incident evidence. An account is
considered an incident if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:
- an allergic reaction or suspected cross-contact
- requesting allergy accommodation (e.g., "peanut allergy", "nut-free")
- staff communication about allergy safety
- explicit statements about allergy safety guarantees (e.g., "they assured it was nut-free")

Ingredient mentions without allergy context (e.g., "peanut sauce is great") are
NOT considered incidents but ARE considered allergy-relevant.

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Incident Severity
Severity of allergic reaction if one occurred

- **No reaction**: No allergic reaction described
- **Mild incident**: Discomfort or minor symptoms that do not include visible swelling/hives and do not require urgent medical care
- **Moderate incident**: Visible symptoms (e.g., hives or swelling) and/or symptoms that required medication (e.g., antihistamine), but not life-threatening
- **Severe incident**: Life-threatening reaction, including any mention of anaphylaxis, EpiPen use, emergency room visit, hospitalization, or explicitly described medical emergency

### Assurance of Safety
Whether staff explicitly assured the food was safe for the allergy

- **Assurance given**: Review states an explicit assurance of safety (e.g., "guaranteed nut-free", "confirmed no peanuts", "assured it was safe for my allergy")
- **No assurance**: Review discusses allergy but contains no explicit assurance claim
- **Unknown**: Text is too vague to determine

### Staff Response
How staff responded when the concern was raised

- **Accommodated**: Staff took the concern seriously and successfully accommodated (ingredient check, substitution, separate preparation, clear warnings)
- **Refused**: Staff stated they could not or would not accommodate
- **Dismissive**: Staff minimized the concern or did not take it seriously
- **Not described**: No staff interaction about the concern is described
- **Unknown**: Unclear from the review


## Scoring System

Calculate a total risk score by summing points from all firsthand incidents.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Mild incident: 2 points
- Moderate incident: 5 points
- Severe incident: 15 points

Additional modifiers:
- False assurance (incident after explicit safety guarantee): +5 points
- Dismissive staff (staff dismissed allergy concern during incident): +3 points
- High-risk cuisine (restaurant is Thai, Vietnamese, or Chinese cuisine): +2 points


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Critical Risk** if any of the following is true:
- Total risk score is 12 or higher

**High Risk** if Critical Risk does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total risk score is 2 or higher

**Low Risk** otherwise
