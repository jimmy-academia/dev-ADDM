# Capacity Management Assessment

Help assess how well this restaurant handles customer volume using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner diagnosing staffing and capacity issues.
Assign a label: Needs Improvement, Satisfactory, or Excellent.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system with recency weighting.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- staffing levels relative to busyness
- how crowded the restaurant was
- whether service suffered when busy
- peak time handling (weekends, holidays)

Reviews that only discuss food quality without mentioning capacity carry less weight.

*Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Staffing Level
Perceived staffing level relative to customer volume

- **severely_understaffed**: Far too few staff for customer volume
- **understaffed**: Noticeably insufficient staff
- **adequate**: Sufficient staff for the volume
- **well_staffed**: Plenty of staff, smooth operations

### Crowd Level
How crowded the restaurant was

- **empty**: Very few or no other customers
- **moderate**: Normal level of customers
- **busy**: Restaurant was busy
- **packed**: Extremely crowded

### Service Degradation
Whether busyness affected service quality

- **none**: Service maintained despite volume
- **minor**: Slight degradation noticeable
- **significant**: Clear service decline due to volume
- **complete**: Service completely collapsed under volume

### Volume Handling
How well they handled customer volume

- **collapsed**: Could not handle the volume at all
- **struggled**: Visible difficulty managing volume
- **managed**: Acceptable handling of volume
- **handled_well**: Impressed by volume management


## Scoring System

Calculate a capacity score by summing points from relevant reviews,
with recency weighting. Staffing levels can change significantly,
so recent reviews are weighted more heavily.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Excellent peak handling: 10 points
- Good volume management: 5 points
- Adequate capacity: 0 points
- Minor capacity issue: -2 points
- Significant understaffing: -5 points
- Complete breakdown: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- Well staffed (staffing praised): +3 points
- Smooth peak times (busy times handled well): +3 points
- Understaffed (not enough staff): -5 points
- Service collapsed (service fell apart under volume): -5 points

Recency weighting (reference date: 2022-01-01):
- Within 6 months: full point value
- 6 months to 1 year: three-quarter point value (multiply by 0.75)
- 1-2 years old: half point value (multiply by 0.5)
- Over 2 years old: quarter point value (multiply by 0.25)


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Excellent** if any of the following is true:
- Total score is 325 or higher (after recency weighting)

**Needs Improvement** if Excellent does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total score is 100 or lower (after recency weighting)

**Satisfactory** otherwise
