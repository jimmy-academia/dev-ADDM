# Romantic Dining Suitability Assessment

Help assess how suitable this restaurant is for romantic dining (dates, anniversaries, proposals)
using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a suitability label: Not Recommended, Acceptable, or Recommended.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system to quantify suitability.

## Definitions of Terms
