# Customer Loyalty Assessment

Help assess customer loyalty and retention indicators using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating customer loyalty.
Assign a label: Low Loyalty, Moderate Loyalty, or High Loyalty.

## Definitions of Terms

## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **High Loyalty** if any of the following is true:
- {'text': 'Multiple reviews describe regulars or repeat customers', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'return_intent': 'regular'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Strong emotional connection expressed', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'emotional_connection': 'strong'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Customers recommend enthusiastically', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'recommend_intent': 'enthusiastic'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Customers return despite issues', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'loyalty_driver': 'despite_issues'}, 'min_count': 2}

**Low Loyalty** if High Loyalty does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- {'text': "Multiple reviews say 'won't return'", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'return_intent': 'never'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'No repeat customer mentions', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'return_intent': ['first_time', 'unlikely']}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Actively discourage others from visiting', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'recommend_intent': 'discourage'}, 'min_count': 2}

**Moderate Loyalty** otherwise, especially when:
- Mixed signals on return intent
- Conditional recommendations
- Some repeat customers mentioned
