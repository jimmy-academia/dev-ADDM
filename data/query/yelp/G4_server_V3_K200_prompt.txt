## Scoring System

Calculate a performance score by summing points from relevant reviews,
with recency weighting applied. Staff turnover means recent reviews
are more indicative of current performance.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Exceptional service experience: 10 points
- Good service: 5 points
- Adequate service: 0 points
- Minor service issue: -2 points
- Significant service issue: -5 points
- Terrible service: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- Named with praise (server mentioned by name with positive feedback): +5 points
- Excellent recommendations (server gave great food/drink recommendations): +3 points
- Recovery from error (error occurred but was handled well): +2 points
- Rude or hostile (server described as rude or having attitude): -5 points
- Unrecovered error (service error not addressed properly): -3 points

Recency weighting:
- Within 6 months: full point value
- 6 months to 1 year: three-quarter point value (multiply by 0.75)
- 1-2 years old: half point value (multiply by 0.5)
- Over 2 years old: quarter point value (multiply by 0.25) - staff likely changed
