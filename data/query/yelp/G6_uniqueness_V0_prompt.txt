# Uniqueness Assessment

Help assess how unique and differentiated this restaurant is using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating competitive positioning.

Reviews that don't mention distinctiveness or memorability carry less weight.

- **Food**: Unique or standout food
- **Atmosphere**: Unique ambiance or setting
- **Service**: Unique service approach
- **Concept**: Unique restaurant concept
- **Location**: Unique location or view
- **None**: Nothing particularly unique

### Differentiation Level

- **Somewhat Different**: Some distinguishing features
- **Unique**: Clearly unique offerings
- **One of a Kind**: Truly irreplaceable experience

### Memorability
How memorable the experience is

- **Forgettable**: Nothing memorable about it
- **Average**: Neither memorable nor forgettable
- **Memorable**: Stands out in memory

### Signature Item
Whether a must-try signature item exists

## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Highly Unique** if any of the following is true:
- {'text': "Multiple reviews describe it as 'one of a kind'", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'differentiation_level': 'one_of_a_kind'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Signature items frequently praised', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'signature_item': 'praised'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Described as unforgettable or irreplaceable', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'memorability': 'unforgettable'}, 'min_count': 2}

**Generic** if Highly Unique does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- {'text': "Multiple reviews describe it as 'nothing special'", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'differentiation_level': 'generic'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'No distinguishing features mentioned', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'unique_aspect': 'none'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Easily confused with competitors', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'differentiation_level': 'interchangeable'}, 'min_count': 2}

**Differentiated** otherwise, especially when:
- Has some unique elements
- Memorable but not irreplaceable
- Some signature items
