## Scoring System

Calculate a quality score by summing points from relevant reviews,
with recency weighting. Environment can change with renovations
or maintenance, so recent reviews are more indicative.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Exceptional atmosphere: 10 points
- Pleasant environment: 5 points
- Adequate environment: 0 points
- Minor environment issue: -2 points
- Significant environment issue: -5 points
- Terrible environment: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- Spotless clean (cleanliness specifically praised): +3 points
- Perfect ambiance (atmosphere matches and enhances concept): +3 points
- Comfortable seating (seating comfort praised): +2 points
- Too loud (noise level a significant problem): -4 points
- Temperature issues (too hot or too cold): -3 points
- Dirty/unclean (cleanliness issues noted): -5 points

Recency weighting:
- Within 6 months: full point value
- 6 months to 1 year: three-quarter point value (multiply by 0.75)
- 1-2 years old: half point value (multiply by 0.5)
- Over 2 years old: quarter point value (multiply by 0.25) - unless describing permanent fixtures
