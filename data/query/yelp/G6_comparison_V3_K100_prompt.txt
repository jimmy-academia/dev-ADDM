## Scoring System

Positive points indicate stronger position, negative points indicate weaker.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Best in area: 10 points
- Better than competitor: 5 points
- Comparable: 0 points
- Worse than competitor: -5 points
- Much worse: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- Customer switched here (won customer from competitor): +5 points
- Recommended over competitor (explicitly preferred): +3 points
- Customer switched away (lost customer to competitor): -5 points
- Warned to go elsewhere (told to go to competitor instead): -3 points


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Stronger** if any of the following is true:
- Total score is 250 or higher

**Weaker** if Stronger does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total score is -100 or lower

**Comparable** otherwise
