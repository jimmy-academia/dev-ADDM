## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Stronger** if any of the following is true:
- Reviews favorably compare overall quality [filter: comparison_outcome=favorable, compared_aspect=overall]
- Reviews show preference and switching to this restaurant [filter: preference_stated=prefer_this, switching_intent=switching_to]
- Reviews favorably compare quality with stated preference [filter: comparison_outcome=favorable, compared_aspect=quality, preference_stated=prefer_this]

**Weaker** if Stronger does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- 12 or more reviews prefer competitors [filter: preference_stated=prefer_other]
- 16 or more reviews describe customers switching away [filter: switching_intent=switching_away]
- 18 or more reviews describe unfavorable comparisons [filter: comparison_outcome=unfavorable]
- 9 or more reviews describe strongly unfavorable comparison [filter: comparison_outcome=strongly_unfavorable]

**Comparable** otherwise, especially when:
- Similar quality to nearby competitors
- Trade-offs between restaurants
- No clear winner in comparisons
