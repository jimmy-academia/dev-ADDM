# Consistency Assessment

Help assess the quality consistency at this restaurant using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner diagnosing reliability.
Assign a label: Needs Improvement, Satisfactory, or Excellent.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system with recency weighting.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- quality changes over time
- comparison to previous visits
- reliability and predictability
- repeat customer observations

Reviews from first-time visitors that don't mention consistency carry less weight.

*Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Quality Trend
Trend in quality over time

- **declining**: Quality has gotten worse
- **stable**: Quality remains consistent
- **improving**: Quality has improved

### Visit Comparison
Current visit compared to previous

- **much_worse**: Significantly worse than before
- **worse**: Noticeably worse than before
- **same**: Same quality as before
- **better**: Better than before
- **much_better**: Significantly improved

### Reliability
How reliable the experience is

- **unpredictable**: Never know what you'll get
- **hit_or_miss**: Sometimes good, sometimes not
- **mostly_reliable**: Usually consistent with occasional issues
- **always_reliable**: Consistently excellent every time

### Visit Frequency
How often reviewer has visited

- **first**: First time at this restaurant
- **few**: Have been a few times
- **regular**: Visit regularly
- **frequent**: Very frequent visitor


## Scoring System

Calculate a consistency score by summing points from relevant reviews,
with recency weighting. For consistency, trend over time is important,
so recency helps identify the current state.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Always excellent: 10 points
- Mostly reliable: 5 points
- Adequate consistency: 0 points
- Some inconsistency: -2 points
- Hit or miss: -5 points
- Completely unpredictable: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- Improving trend (quality getting better): +3 points
- Regular customer praise (frequent visitor praises consistency): +3 points
- Declining trend (quality getting worse): -5 points
- Management change decline (quality dropped after ownership/management change): -3 points

Recency weighting (reference date: 2022-01-01):
- Within 6 months: full point value
- 6 months to 1 year: three-quarter point value (multiply by 0.75)
- 1-2 years old: half point value (multiply by 0.5)
- Over 2 years old: quarter point value (multiply by 0.25)


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Excellent** if any of the following is true:
- Total score is 100 or higher (after recency weighting)

**Needs Improvement** if Excellent does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total score is -100 or lower (after recency weighting)

**Satisfactory** otherwise
