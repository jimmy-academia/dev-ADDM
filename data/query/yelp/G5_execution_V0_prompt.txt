# Execution Quality Assessment

Help assess how well this restaurant executes orders and keeps promises using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner diagnosing operational issues.
Assign a label: Needs Improvement, Satisfactory, or Excellent.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- order accuracy (correct items, modifications)
- promises made and kept
- how issues were resolved
- menu accuracy and descriptions

Reviews that only discuss ambiance without mentioning order execution carry less weight.

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Order Accuracy
Whether orders were fulfilled correctly

- **Perfect**: Everything correct, no issues
- **Minor Error**: Small mistake, easily fixed
- **Significant Error**: Major order problem
- **Multiple Errors**: Several mistakes on single order

### Modification Handling
How well they handled special requests

- **Refused**: Would not accommodate modification
- **Ignored**: Modification request was ignored
- **Attempted**: Tried but got it wrong
- **Successful**: Modification handled correctly

### Promise Kept
Whether stated commitments were honored

- **Broken**: Promise was not kept
- **Partial**: Promise partially fulfilled
- **Kept**: Promise was fulfilled

### Issue Resolution
How well problems were resolved

- **None**: Issue not addressed
- **Poor**: Attempted but inadequate resolution
- **Adequate**: Acceptable resolution
- **Excellent**: Went above and beyond to fix


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Excellent** if any of the following is true:
- {'text': 'Multiple reviews praise order accuracy', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'order_accuracy': 'perfect'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Modifications consistently handled well', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'modification_handling': 'excellent'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Issue resolution goes above and beyond', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'issue_resolution': 'exceptional'}, 'min_count': 2}

**Needs Improvement** if Excellent does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- {'text': 'Multiple reviews report wrong orders', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'order_accuracy': 'wrong'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Modifications frequently ignored', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'modification_handling': 'ignored'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Promises consistently broken', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'promise_kept': 'broken'}, 'min_count': 2}

**Satisfactory** otherwise, especially when:
- Orders generally correct
- Occasional issues handled adequately
- Most promises kept
