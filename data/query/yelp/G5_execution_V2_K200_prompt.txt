# Execution Quality Assessment

Help assess how well this restaurant executes orders and keeps promises using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner diagnosing operational issues.
Assign a label: Needs Improvement, Satisfactory, or Excellent.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- order accuracy (correct items, modifications)
- promises made and kept
- how issues were resolved
- menu accuracy and descriptions

Reviews that only discuss ambiance without mentioning order execution carry less weight.

*Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Order Accuracy
Whether orders were fulfilled correctly

- **perfect**: Everything correct, no issues
- **minor_error**: Small mistake, easily fixed
- **significant_error**: Major order problem
- **multiple_errors**: Several mistakes on single order

### Modification Handling
How well they handled special requests

- **refused**: Would not accommodate modification
- **ignored**: Modification request was ignored
- **attempted**: Tried but got it wrong
- **successful**: Modification handled correctly

### Promise Kept
Whether stated commitments were honored

- **broken**: Promise was not kept
- **partial**: Promise partially fulfilled
- **kept**: Promise was fulfilled

### Issue Resolution
How well problems were resolved

- **none**: Issue not addressed
- **poor**: Attempted but inadequate resolution
- **adequate**: Acceptable resolution
- **excellent**: Went above and beyond to fix
