# Business Dining Suitability Assessment

Help assess how suitable this restaurant is for business dining (client meetings, work lunches, interviews)
using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a suitability label: Not Recommended, Acceptable, or Recommended.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system with recency weighting.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- business lunches, client meetings, interviews, work events
- noise level and ability to have conversation
- service efficiency and professionalism
- privacy for business discussions
- overall professional atmosphere

Reviews that only discuss food without mentioning the business context carry less weight.

*Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Professionalism
Overall professional atmosphere

- **poor**: Unprofessional, inappropriate for business
- **adequate**: Acceptable for casual business, not formal
- **good**: Professional atmosphere, suitable for most business
- **excellent**: Highly professional, suitable for important clients

### Conversation Suitability

- **poor**: Too loud or distracting for business discussion
- **fair**: Possible to talk but some challenges
- **good**: Comfortable for business conversation

### Service Efficiency
Service efficiency for busy professionals

- **moderate**: Reasonable privacy for most business talk
- **high**: Private rooms or very secluded tables available

### Meeting Outcome

## Scoring System

Calculate a business suitability score by summing points from relevant reviews,
with recency weighting applied.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Successful client meeting: 15 points
- Positive business meal: 5 points
- Neutral mention: 0 points
- Minor issue (slightly loud, slow): -2 points
- Major issue (too loud, very slow): -5 points
- Client embarrassment: -15 points

Additional modifiers:
- Private room available (mentions private dining room or secluded area): +5 points
- Quiet atmosphere (explicitly describes as quiet or easy to talk): +3 points
- Efficient service (service described as quick and professional): +3 points
- Loud environment (noise level prevents easy conversation): -5 points
- Slow service (service too slow for business timing): -3 points

Recency weighting (reference date: 2022-01-01):
- Within 1 year: full point value
- 1-2 years old: half point value (multiply by 0.5)
- Over 2 years old: quarter point value (multiply by 0.25)


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Recommended** if any of the following is true:
- Total suitability score is 150 or higher (after recency weighting)

**Not Recommended** if Recommended does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total suitability score is 70 or lower (after recency weighting)

**Acceptable** otherwise
