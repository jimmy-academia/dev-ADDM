# Capacity Management Assessment

Help assess how well this restaurant handles customer volume using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner diagnosing staffing and capacity issues.
Assign a label: Needs Improvement, Satisfactory, or Excellent.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- staffing levels relative to busyness
- how crowded the restaurant was
- whether service suffered when busy
- peak time handling (weekends, holidays)

Reviews that only discuss food quality without mentioning capacity carry less weight.

*Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Staffing Level
Perceived staffing level relative to customer volume

- **severely_understaffed**: Far too few staff for customer volume
- **understaffed**: Noticeably insufficient staff
- **adequate**: Sufficient staff for the volume
- **well_staffed**: Plenty of staff, smooth operations

### Crowd Level
How crowded the restaurant was

- **empty**: Very few or no other customers
- **moderate**: Normal level of customers
- **busy**: Restaurant was busy
- **packed**: Extremely crowded

### Service Degradation
Whether busyness affected service quality

- **none**: Service maintained despite volume
- **minor**: Slight degradation noticeable
- **significant**: Clear service decline due to volume
- **complete**: Service completely collapsed under volume

### Volume Handling
How well they handled customer volume

- **collapsed**: Could not handle the volume at all
- **struggled**: Visible difficulty managing volume
- **managed**: Acceptable handling of volume
- **handled_well**: Impressed by volume management


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Excellent** if any of the following is true:
- Reviews praise volume handling during busy periods
- Reviews show well-staffed with no service degradation
- Reviews praise handling when packed

**Needs Improvement** if Excellent does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- 14 or more reviews describe understaffing
- 16 or more reviews describe significant service degradation
- 16 or more reviews report volume handling struggles
- 6 or more reviews describe severely understaffed situation
- 9 or more reviews describe complete service degradation

**Satisfactory** otherwise, especially when:
- Adequate handling most of the time
- Occasional peak-time struggles
- Generally manages volume acceptably
