## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- food quality issues (temperature, doneness, taste)
- consistency of food quality across visits
- presentation and plating
- chef skill level
- food sent back or complaints addressed

Reviews that only discuss service without mentioning food quality carry less weight.

*Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Food Issue Type

- **temperature**: Food served at wrong temperature
- **doneness**: Food over or undercooked
- **taste**: Flavor issues (bland, too salty, etc.)
- **presentation**: Visual presentation issues
- **portion**: Portion size issues
- **none**: No food issues mentioned

### Issue Severity
Severity of food quality issues

- **none**: No issues, food was good
- **minor**: Small issues, still edible
- **major**: Significant issues affecting enjoyment
- **inedible**: Food was not edible

### Consistency
Consistency of food quality

- **inconsistent**: Quality varies significantly between visits/dishes

### Chef Skill

## Scoring System

Calculate a performance score by summing points from relevant reviews,
with recency weighting applied. Chef changes and menu updates mean
recent reviews are more indicative of current quality.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Exceptional food quality: 10 points
- Good food quality: 5 points
- Adequate food quality: 0 points
- Minor food issue: -2 points
- Significant food issue: -5 points
- Inedible food: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- Consistent excellence (same great quality across visits): +5 points
- Creative/unique dishes (chef praised for creativity): +3 points
- Beautiful presentation (plating and presentation praised): +2 points
- Inconsistent quality (hit or miss between visits): -5 points
- Food sent back (dish had to be returned): -3 points

Recency weighting (reference date: 2022-01-01):
- Within 6 months: full point value
- 6 months to 1 year: three-quarter point value (multiply by 0.75)
- 1-2 years old: half point value (multiply by 0.5)
- Over 2 years old: quarter point value (multiply by 0.25)


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Excellent** if any of the following is true:
- Total performance score is 700 or higher (after recency weighting)

**Needs Improvement** if Excellent does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total performance score is 250 or lower (after recency weighting)

**Satisfactory** otherwise
