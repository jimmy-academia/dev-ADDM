# Customer Loyalty Assessment

Help assess customer loyalty and retention indicators using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating customer loyalty.

## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **High Loyalty** if any of the following is true:
- 28 or more reviews describe high emotional connection [filter: emotional_connection=high]
- 32 or more reviews strongly recommend [filter: recommend_intent=strongly_recommend]
- 28 or more reviews say they would definitely return [filter: return_intent=definitely]

**Low Loyalty** if High Loyalty does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- 12 or more reviews say 'will never return' [filter: return_intent=never]
- 18 or more reviews report unlikely to return [filter: return_intent=unlikely]
- 18 or more reviews warn others [filter: recommend_intent=warn_others]

**Moderate Loyalty** otherwise, especially when:
- Mixed signals on return intent
- Conditional recommendations
- Some repeat customers mentioned
