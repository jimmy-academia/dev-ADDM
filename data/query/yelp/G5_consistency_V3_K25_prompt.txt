- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

## Scoring System

- Always excellent: 10 points
- Mostly reliable: 5 points
- Adequate consistency: 0 points
- Some inconsistency: -2 points
- Hit or miss: -5 points
- Completely unpredictable: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- Improving trend (quality getting better): +3 points
- Regular customer praise (frequent visitor praises consistency): +3 points
- Declining trend (quality getting worse): -5 points
- Management change decline (quality dropped after ownership/management change): -3 points

- Total score is 100 or higher

**Needs Improvement** if Excellent does not apply, but any of the following is true:
