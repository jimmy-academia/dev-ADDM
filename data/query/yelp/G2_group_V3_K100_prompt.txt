# Group Dining Suitability Assessment

Help assess how suitable this restaurant is for group dining (large parties, celebrations, family gatherings)
using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a suitability label: Not Recommended, Acceptable, or Recommended.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system with recency weighting.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- large group dining, parties, celebrations, birthday dinners
- ability to accommodate large parties
- wait times for groups, reservation handling
- check splitting, group service coordination
- family-friendliness (if relevant)

Reviews from solo diners or couples carry less weight unless they comment on observed group experiences.

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Group Size
Size of the dining group

- **Small (4-6)**: Small group of 4-6 people
- **Medium (7-10)**: Medium group of 7-10 people
- **Large (10+)**: Large group of more than 10 people

### Accommodation Quality
How well the restaurant handled the group

- **Poor**: Could not or would not accommodate group well
- **Adequate**: Basic accommodation, nothing special
- **Good**: Handled group well, smooth experience
- **Excellent**: Exceptional group handling, private room, coordinated service

### Check Splitting
How easy it was to split the check

- **Refused**: Restaurant would not split the check
- **Difficult**: Splitting was possible but problematic
- **Easy**: No issues splitting the check

### Wait Time
Wait time for large party seating

- **Excessive**: Unreasonably long wait despite reservation
- **Long**: Significant wait but not unreasonable
- **Reasonable**: Acceptable wait for group size
- **Quick**: Seated quickly, minimal wait

### Family Friendliness
How family-friendly the restaurant is

- **Not Suitable**: Not appropriate for children/families
- **Tolerant**: Allows children but not particularly welcoming
- **Friendly**: Welcoming to families, kids menu available
- **Exceptional**: Designed for families, activities for kids

### Group Outcome
Overall success of the group dining experience

- **Disaster**: Group experience was a disaster
- **Mixed**: Some issues but overall acceptable
- **Success**: Group had a good experience
- **Great**: Exceptional group experience


## Scoring System

Calculate a group suitability score by summing points from relevant reviews,
with recency weighting applied.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Perfect group event: 15 points
- Positive group experience: 5 points
- Neutral mention: 0 points
- Minor group issue: -2 points
- Major group issue: -5 points
- Group disaster: -15 points

Additional modifiers:
- Private room available (private dining space for groups): +5 points
- Easy check splitting (no issues splitting checks): +3 points
- Family-friendly (kids menu, high chairs, family welcoming): +3 points
- Refused check split (would not split the check): -5 points
- Long wait despite reservation (waited excessively despite having reservation): -5 points
- Group split across tables (party was not seated together): -3 points

Recency weighting:
- Within 1 year: full point value
- 1-2 years old: half point value (multiply by 0.5)
- Over 2 years old: quarter point value (multiply by 0.25), unless describing permanent features (private room, layout)


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Recommended** if any of the following is true:
- Total suitability score is 2000 or higher (after recency weighting)

**Not Recommended** if Recommended does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total suitability score is 600 or lower (after recency weighting)

**Acceptable** otherwise, especially when:
- Total suitability score is between 601 and 1999
- Recent reviews show improved group handling
- Older negative reviews countered by recent positive ones
