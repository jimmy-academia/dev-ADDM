# Group Dining Suitability Assessment

Help assess how suitable this restaurant is for group dining (large parties, celebrations, family gatherings)
using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a suitability label: Not Recommended, Acceptable, or Recommended.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- large group dining, parties, celebrations, birthday dinners
- ability to accommodate large parties
- wait times for groups, reservation handling
- check splitting, group service coordination
- family-friendliness (if relevant)

Reviews from solo diners or couples carry less weight unless they comment on observed group experiences.

*Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Group Size

### Wait Time
Wait time for large party seating

- **Excessive**: Unreasonably long wait despite reservation

- **Great**: Exceptional group experience


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Recommended** if any of the following is true:
- 5 or more reviews describe successful large group events [filter: group_outcome=positive, group_size=large]
- 20 or more reviews mention private rooms or dedicated group areas positively [filter: accommodation_quality=excellent]
- 70 or more reviews praise the handling of groups [filter: accommodation_quality=['good', 'excellent']]
- 5 or more reviews describe exceptional family friendliness [filter: family_friendliness=exceptional]

**Not Recommended** if Recommended does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- 30 or more reviews describe groups being turned away or poorly handled [filter: accommodation_quality=poor]
- 15 or more complaints about long waits despite reservations [filter: wait_time=excessive]
- 10 or more reviews report refused check splitting for groups [filter: check_splitting=refused]
- 10 or more reviews describe disaster group outcomes [filter: group_outcome=disaster]

**Acceptable** otherwise, especially when:
- Handles groups adequately but not exceptionally
- Suitable for medium groups but struggles with large ones
- Mixed experiences reported
