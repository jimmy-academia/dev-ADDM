# Group Dining Suitability Assessment

Help assess how suitable this restaurant is for group dining (large parties, celebrations, family gatherings)
using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a suitability label: Not Recommended, Acceptable, or Recommended.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system to quantify suitability.

## Definitions of Terms

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- large group dining, parties, celebrations, birthday dinners
- ability to accommodate large parties
- wait times for groups, reservation handling
- check splitting, group service coordination
- family-friendliness (if relevant)

Reviews from solo diners or couples carry less weight unless they comment on observed group experiences.

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Group Size
Size of the dining group

- **Small (4-6)**: Small group of 4-6 people
- **Medium (7-10)**: Medium group of 7-10 people

### Wait Time
Wait time for large party seating

- **Excessive**: Unreasonably long wait despite reservation

### Family Friendliness
How family-friendly the restaurant is

- **Not Suitable**: Not appropriate for children/families

## Scoring System

Calculate a group suitability score by summing points from relevant reviews.
Positive points indicate group suitability, negative points indicate drawbacks.

- Minor group issue: -2 points
- Major group issue: -5 points
- Group disaster: -15 points

Additional modifiers:
- Private room available (private dining space for groups): +5 points
- Easy check splitting (no issues splitting checks): +3 points
- Family-friendly (kids menu, high chairs, family welcoming): +3 points
- Refused check split (would not split the check): -5 points
- Long wait despite reservation (waited excessively despite having reservation): -5 points
- Group split across tables (party was not seated together): -3 points
