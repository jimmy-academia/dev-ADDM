# Execution Quality Assessment

Help assess how well this restaurant executes orders and keeps promises using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner diagnosing operational issues.
Assign a label: Needs Improvement, Satisfactory, or Excellent.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- order accuracy (correct items, modifications)
- promises made and kept
- how issues were resolved
- menu accuracy and descriptions

Reviews that only discuss ambiance without mentioning order execution carry less weight.

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Order Accuracy
Whether orders were fulfilled correctly

- **Perfect**: Everything correct, no issues
- **Minor Error**: Small mistake, easily fixed
- **Significant Error**: Major order problem
- **Multiple Errors**: Several mistakes on single order

### Modification Handling
How well they handled special requests

- **Refused**: Would not accommodate modification
- **Ignored**: Modification request was ignored
- **Attempted**: Tried but got it wrong
- **Successful**: Modification handled correctly

### Promise Kept
Whether stated commitments were honored

- **Broken**: Promise was not kept
- **Partial**: Promise partially fulfilled
- **Kept**: Promise was fulfilled

### Issue Resolution
How well problems were resolved

- **None**: Issue not addressed
- **Poor**: Attempted but inadequate resolution
- **Adequate**: Acceptable resolution
- **Excellent**: Went above and beyond to fix


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Excellent** if any of the following is true:
- 48 or more reviews report perfect order accuracy [filter: order_accuracy=perfect]
- 28 or more reviews report successful modification handling [filter: modification_handling=successful]
- 45 or more reviews report promises kept [filter: promise_kept=kept]
- 20 or more reviews describe excellent issue resolution [filter: issue_resolution=excellent]

**Needs Improvement** if Excellent does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- 46 or more reviews report significant or multiple order errors [filter: order_accuracy=['multiple_errors', 'significant_error']]
- 49 or more reviews report modifications being ignored [filter: modification_handling=ignored]
- 46 or more reviews report broken promises [filter: promise_kept=broken]
- 48 or more reviews describe no issue resolution [filter: issue_resolution=none]

**Satisfactory** otherwise, especially when:
- Orders mostly correct with occasional errors
- Issues acknowledged and addressed
- Reasonable accommodation of requests
