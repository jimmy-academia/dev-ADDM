# Uniqueness Assessment

Help assess how unique and differentiated this restaurant is using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating competitive positioning.
Assign a label: Generic, Differentiated, or Highly Unique.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- what makes the restaurant special or different
- signature dishes or unique offerings
- memorable experiences
- comparisons to other restaurants

Reviews that don't mention distinctiveness or memorability carry less weight.

### Account Type

- **firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

What aspect makes this restaurant unique

- **food**: Unique or standout food
- **atmosphere**: Unique ambiance or setting

- **one_of_a_kind**: Truly irreplaceable experience

### Memorability
How memorable the experience is

## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Highly Unique** if any of the following is true:
- Reviews describe unique food with unforgettable experience
- Reviews describe one-of-a-kind differentiation

**Generic** if Highly Unique does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- 26 or more reviews describe it as 'nothing special'
- 26 or more reviews mention no distinguishing features
- 20 or more reviews describe it as easily confused with competitors

**Differentiated** otherwise, especially when:
- Has some unique elements
- Memorable but not irreplaceable
- Some signature items
