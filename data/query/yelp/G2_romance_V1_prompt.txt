# Romantic Dining Suitability Assessment

Help assess how suitable this restaurant is for romantic dining (dates, anniversaries, proposals)
using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a suitability label: Not Recommended, Acceptable, or Recommended.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- date nights, anniversaries, romantic occasions, proposals

Reviews that only discuss food without mentioning atmosphere carry less weight.

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Ambiance Quality

Lighting appropriateness for romantic dining

## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Recommended** if any of the following is true:
- {'text': 'At least 1 review describes a successful proposal or memorable anniversary', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'date_outcome': 'exceptional'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Candlelit or intimate atmosphere explicitly praised', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'lighting_quality': 'intimate', 'ambiance_quality': 'excellent'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': "Multiple reviews describe it as 'perfect for dates'", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'ambiance_quality': 'romantic'}, 'min_count': 2}

**Not Recommended** if Recommended does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- {'text': "At least 1 review describes a date being 'ruined' by the experience", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'date_outcome': 'ruined'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': "Described as 'too loud to talk' or 'like a cafeteria'", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'noise_level': ['very_loud', 'unbearable']}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': "Rushed service that doesn't allow lingering", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'service_style': 'rushed'}, 'min_count': 1}

**Acceptable** otherwise, especially when:
- Atmosphere is pleasant but not particularly romantic
- Good for casual dates but not special occasions
- Mixed reviews about ambiance
