# Kitchen Performance Assessment

Help assess the kitchen performance at this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating their kitchen team's execution.
Assign a performance label: Needs Improvement, Satisfactory, or Excellent.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- food quality issues (temperature, doneness, taste)
- consistency of food quality across visits
- presentation and plating
- chef skill level
- food sent back or complaints addressed

Reviews that only discuss service without mentioning food quality carry less weight.

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Food Issue Type

- **Temperature**: Food served at wrong temperature
- **Doneness**: Food over or undercooked
- **Taste**: Flavor issues (bland, too salty, etc.)
- **Presentation**: Visual presentation issues
- **Portion**: Portion size issues
- **None**: No food issues mentioned

### Issue Severity
Severity of food quality issues

- **None**: No issues, food was good
- **Minor**: Small issues, still edible
- **Major**: Significant issues affecting enjoyment
- **Inedible**: Food was not edible

### Consistency
Consistency of food quality

- **Inconsistent**: Quality varies significantly between visits/dishes
- **Variable**: Some variation but generally acceptable
- **Consistent**: Reliable quality every time

### Chef Skill
Perceived skill level of kitchen

- **Poor**: Kitchen seems unskilled
- **Average**: Competent but unremarkable
- **Good**: Skilled kitchen, quality execution

## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Excellent** if any of the following is true:
- {'text': 'Multiple reviews praise food quality and consistency', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'consistency': 'excellent'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Chef skill consistently praised as exceptional', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'chef_skill': 'exceptional'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Rarely or never any food quality issues reported', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'food_issue_type': 'none'}, 'min_count': 2}

**Needs Improvement** if Excellent does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- {'text': 'Multiple reviews report food quality issues', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'issue_severity': ['moderate', 'severe']}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Consistency problems reported (hit or miss)', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'consistency': 'inconsistent'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Food frequently sent back or described as inedible', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'food_sent_back': True}, 'min_count': 2}

**Satisfactory** otherwise, especially when:
- Food quality is acceptable but not exceptional
- Some good dishes, some less impressive
- Occasional issues but generally competent
