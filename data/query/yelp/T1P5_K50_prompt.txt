# Allergy Safety Risk Assessment

Help assess the allergy safety risk for this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

## Assessment Framework

### Critical Risk

**Relevant Definitions:**
- **Account Type**: How the reviewer relates to the described event
  - Firsthand: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
  - Secondhand: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
  - Hypothetical: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")
- **Incident Severity**: Severity of allergic reaction if one occurred
  - No reaction: No allergic reaction described
  - Mild incident: Discomfort or minor symptoms that do not include visible swelling/hives and do not require urgent medical care
  - Moderate incident: Visible symptoms (e.g., hives or swelling) and/or symptoms that required medication (e.g., antihistamine), but not life-threatening
  - Severe incident: Life-threatening reaction, including any mention of anaphylaxis, EpiPen use, emergency room visit, hospitalization, or explicitly described medical emergency
- **Assurance of Safety**: Whether staff explicitly assured the food was safe for the allergy
  - Assurance given: Review states an explicit assurance of safety (e.g., "guaranteed nut-free", "confirmed no peanuts", "assured it was safe for my allergy")
  - No assurance: Review discusses allergy but contains no explicit assurance claim
  - Unknown: Text is too vague to determine
- **Staff Response**: How staff responded when the concern was raised
  - Accommodated: Staff took the concern seriously and successfully accommodated (ingredient check, substitution, separate preparation, clear warnings)
  - Refused: Staff stated they could not or would not accommodate
  - Dismissive: Staff minimized the concern or did not take it seriously
  - Not described: No staff interaction about the concern is described
  - Unknown: Unclear from the review

**Applies when:**
- 1 or more severe firsthand incidents are reported
- 2 or more moderate firsthand incidents are reported


### High Risk

**Relevant Definitions:**
- **Account Type**: How the reviewer relates to the described event
  - Firsthand: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
  - Secondhand: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
  - Hypothetical: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")
- **Incident Severity**: Severity of allergic reaction if one occurred
  - No reaction: No allergic reaction described
  - Mild incident: Discomfort or minor symptoms that do not include visible swelling/hives and do not require urgent medical care
  - Moderate incident: Visible symptoms (e.g., hives or swelling) and/or symptoms that required medication (e.g., antihistamine), but not life-threatening
  - Severe incident: Life-threatening reaction, including any mention of anaphylaxis, EpiPen use, emergency room visit, hospitalization, or explicitly described medical emergency
- **Assurance of Safety**: Whether staff explicitly assured the food was safe for the allergy
  - Assurance given: Review states an explicit assurance of safety (e.g., "guaranteed nut-free", "confirmed no peanuts", "assured it was safe for my allergy")
  - No assurance: Review discusses allergy but contains no explicit assurance claim
  - Unknown: Text is too vague to determine

  - Dismissive: Staff minimized the concern or did not take it seriously
  - Not described: No staff interaction about the concern is described
  - Unknown: Unclear from the review

**Applies when:**
- 1 or more mild or moderate firsthand incidents are reported


### Low Risk (Default)
Applies when no other verdict conditions are met.

**Especially when:**
- No firsthand incidents are reported
- Allergy-relevant reviews describe consistent accommodation behavior
