# Hygiene and Food Safety Risk Assessment

Help assess the hygiene and food safety risk for this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Only firsthand observations are treated as confirmed evidence. An account is
considered relevant if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:
- visible cleanliness issues (dirty tables, floors, kitchen, bathroom)
- pest sightings (insects, rodents)
- food safety concerns (hair in food, undercooked, spoiled)
- illness after eating at the restaurant

Vague statements without specific observations (e.g., "seemed clean") carry less weight.

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Issue Type

- **Cleanliness**: General cleanliness issues (dirty tables, floors, etc.)
- **Pest**: Pest sighting (insects, rodents)
- **Food Safety**: Food handling or preparation issues
- **Bathroom**: Bathroom cleanliness issues
- **Other**: Other hygiene issues not categorized above

### Issue Severity
Severity of the hygiene issue

- **No issue**: No hygiene issue described
- **Minor issue**: Small cleanliness issue that doesn't affect food safety
- **Major issue**: Significant cleanliness problem, health concern
- **Severe issue**: Health code violation level, food poisoning reported

### Observation Type
How the hygiene issue was observed

- **Witnessed**: Reviewer directly saw the issue
- **Inferred**: Reviewer inferred issue from other evidence
- **Reported**: Issue reported by others or known from external source

### Illness Reported
Whether the reviewer or their party got sick

- **True**: Reviewer or party members reported getting sick after eating

## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Critical Risk** if any of the following is true:
- {'text': '2 or more reviews report food poisoning or illness', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'illness_reported': True, 'account_type': 'firsthand'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Pest sightings (roaches, rodents) reported in multiple reviews', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'issue_type': ['pest', 'rodent', 'roach'], 'account_type': 'firsthand'}, 'min_count': 2}

**High Risk** if Critical Risk does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- {'text': '2 or more reviews describe major cleanliness issues', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'issue_severity': 'major', 'account_type': 'firsthand'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'At least 1 review reports food poisoning', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'illness_reported': True, 'account_type': 'firsthand'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Multiple reviews describe hair or foreign objects in food', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'issue_type': ['foreign_object', 'hair'], 'account_type': 'firsthand'}, 'min_count': 2}

**Low Risk** otherwise, especially when:
- No hygiene issues are reported
- Reviews describe the restaurant as clean
- No illness reports
