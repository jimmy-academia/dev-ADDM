# Time-Value Assessment

Help assess whether waiting at this restaurant is worth it using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a verdict: Not Worth Waiting, Worth Waiting, or Definitely Worth Waiting.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system to quantify time-value.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- wait times for seating, food, or service
- reservations and whether they were honored
- whether the wait was justified by the experience
- willingness to wait again

Reviews that don't mention timing or waiting carry less weight.

*Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Wait Type
What type of wait occurred

- **seating**: Wait for a table
- **food**: Wait for food to arrive
- **check**: Wait for check/bill
- **reservation**: Wait despite having reservation

### Wait Duration
How long the wait was

- **none**: Seated or served immediately
- **short**: Brief wait (under 15 minutes)
- **moderate**: Moderate wait (15-30 minutes)
- **long**: Long wait (30-60 minutes)
- **excessive**: Unreasonably long wait (over 60 minutes)

### Wait Justification
Was the wait justified by the experience

- **not_worth_it**: Wait was not worth the experience
- **barely**: Marginal justification for the wait
- **worth_it**: Experience justified the wait
- **definitely_worth_it**: Experience far exceeded expectations, wait was trivial

### Would Wait Again
Would customer wait again for this restaurant

- **never**: Would not wait again
- **maybe**: Might wait under certain conditions
- **yes**: Would wait again
- **definitely**: Would definitely wait again


## Scoring System

Calculate a time-value score by summing points from relevant reviews.
Positive points indicate worth waiting, negative points indicate not worth it.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Exceptional - worth any wait: 10 points
- Worth the wait: 5 points
- Neutral/acceptable wait: 0 points
- Wait somewhat not worth it: -3 points
- Definitely not worth waiting: -5 points
- Left due to wait/complete waste: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- No wait ever (always seated immediately): +3 points
- Reservations honored (reservations work well): +2 points
- Would wait again (reviewer would gladly wait again): +3 points
- Reservations not honored (had reservation but still waited long): -5 points
- Would not wait again (reviewer explicitly wouldn't wait again): -3 points


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Definitely Worth Waiting** if any of the following is true:
- Total time-value score is 1400 or higher

**Not Worth Waiting** if Definitely Worth Waiting does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total time-value score is 500 or lower

**Worth Waiting** otherwise
