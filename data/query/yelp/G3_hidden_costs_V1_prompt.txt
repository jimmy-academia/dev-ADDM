# Hidden Costs Risk Assessment

Help assess the risk of unexpected charges at this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- unexpected charges on the bill
- mandatory service charges or auto-gratuity
- corkage fees, split fees, or other surcharges
- bill surprises or lack of price transparency
- fine print charges

Reviews that only discuss food without mentioning billing carry less weight.

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Cost Type
Type of hidden or unexpected cost

- **Service Charge**: Mandatory service charge added to bill
- **Auto Gratuity**: Automatic tip added to bill
- **Corkage Fee**: Fee for bringing own wine
- **Split Fee**: Fee for splitting dishes or checks
- **Other**: Other unexpected charges

### Disclosure Level
How well the hidden cost was disclosed

- **No Disclosure**: Not mentioned until bill arrived
- **Fine Print**: Mentioned in small print on menu
- **Verbal**: Server mentioned it verbally
- **Clear**: Clearly displayed or communicated

### Impact Severity
Impact of hidden cost on total bill

- **Minor**: Small percentage of bill (<5%)
- **Moderate**: Noticeable addition (5-15%)
- **Significant**: Major impact on bill (>15%)

### Customer Reaction
Customer's reaction to the hidden cost

- **Upset**: Very unhappy about undisclosed charges
- **Annoyed**: Mildly annoyed but not deal-breaker
- **Neutral**: Accepted the charge
- **Understanding**: Understood and accepted the charge


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Critical Risk** if any of the following is true:
- {'text': 'At least 1 review describes bill being significantly higher than expected without warning', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'impact_severity': 'major', 'disclosure_level': 'none'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Undisclosed fees greater than 15% of expected bill', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'impact_severity': 'significant'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Multiple charges hidden from customers until bill arrives', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'disclosure_level': 'none'}, 'min_count': 2}

**High Risk** if Critical Risk does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- {'text': 'At least 1 review mentions unexpected service charge or auto-gratuity', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'cost_type': ['service_charge', 'auto_gratuity']}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Fees mentioned only in fine print or not disclosed', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'disclosure_level': ['fine_print', 'none']}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Customer describes feeling deceived about pricing', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'customer_reaction': 'deceived'}, 'min_count': 1}

**Low Risk** otherwise, especially when:
- No mentions of hidden charges
- Fees are clearly disclosed upfront
- Transparent pricing praised
