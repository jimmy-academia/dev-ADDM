# Hygiene and Food Safety Risk Assessment

Help assess the hygiene and food safety risk for this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system with recency weighting.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Only firsthand observations are treated as confirmed evidence. An account is
considered relevant if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:
- visible cleanliness issues (dirty tables, floors, kitchen, bathroom)
- pest sightings (insects, rodents)
- food safety concerns (hair in food, undercooked, spoiled)
- illness after eating at the restaurant

Vague statements without specific observations (e.g., "seemed clean") carry less weight.

*Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Issue Type
Type of hygiene issue reported

- **Cleanliness**: General cleanliness issues (dirty tables, floors, etc.)
- **Pest**: Pest sighting (insects, rodents)
- **Food Safety**: Food handling or preparation issues
- **Bathroom**: Bathroom cleanliness issues
- **Other**: Other hygiene issues not categorized above

### Issue Severity
Severity of the hygiene issue

- **No issue**: No hygiene issue described
- **Minor issue**: Small cleanliness issue that doesn't affect food safety
- **Major issue**: Significant cleanliness problem, health concern
- **Severe issue**: Health code violation level, food poisoning reported

### Observation Type
How the hygiene issue was observed

- **Witnessed**: Reviewer directly saw the issue
- **Inferred**: Reviewer inferred issue from other evidence
- **Reported**: Issue reported by others or known from external source

### Illness Reported
Whether the reviewer or their party got sick

- **True**: Reviewer or party members reported getting sick after eating
- **False**: No illness reported
- **Unknown**: Unclear from the review

### Staff Response
How staff responded when the concern was raised

- **Accommodated**: Staff took the concern seriously and successfully accommodated (ingredient check, substitution, separate preparation, clear warnings)
- **Refused**: Staff stated they could not or would not accommodate
- **Dismissive**: Staff minimized the concern or did not take it seriously
- **Not described**: No staff interaction about the concern is described
- **Unknown**: Unclear from the review


## Scoring System

Calculate a total risk score by summing points from all firsthand hygiene incidents,
with recency weighting applied.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Minor issue: 2 points
- Major issue: 5 points
- Severe issue (illness, rodent): 15 points

Additional modifiers:
- Food poisoning (reviewer or party got sick after eating): +10 points
- Pest sighting (roaches, flies, rodents observed): +5 points
- Dismissive staff (staff dismissed or ignored hygiene complaint): +3 points
- Multiple affected (multiple people in party experienced same issue): +3 points

Recency weighting (reference date: 2022-01-01):
- Within 1 year: full point value
- 1-2 years old: half point value (multiply by 0.5)
- Over 2 years old: quarter point value (multiply by 0.25)


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Critical Risk** if any of the following is true:
- Total risk score is 75 or higher (after recency weighting)

**High Risk** if Critical Risk does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total risk score is 25 or higher (after recency weighting)

**Low Risk** otherwise
