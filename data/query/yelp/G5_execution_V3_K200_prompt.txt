# Execution Quality Assessment

Help assess how well this restaurant executes orders and keeps promises using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner diagnosing operational issues.
Assign a label: Needs Improvement, Satisfactory, or Excellent.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system to quantify performance.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- order accuracy (correct items, modifications)
- promises made and kept
- how issues were resolved
- menu accuracy and descriptions

Reviews that only discuss ambiance without mentioning order execution carry less weight.

*Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Order Accuracy
Whether orders were fulfilled correctly

- **Perfect**: Everything correct, no issues
- **Minor Error**: Small mistake, easily fixed
- **Significant Error**: Major order problem
- **Multiple Errors**: Several mistakes on single order

### Modification Handling
How well they handled special requests

- **Refused**: Would not accommodate modification
- **Ignored**: Modification request was ignored
- **Attempted**: Tried but got it wrong
- **Successful**: Modification handled correctly

### Promise Kept
Whether stated commitments were honored

- **Broken**: Promise was not kept
- **Partial**: Promise partially fulfilled
- **Kept**: Promise was fulfilled

### Issue Resolution
How well problems were resolved

- **None**: Issue not addressed
- **Poor**: Attempted but inadequate resolution
- **Adequate**: Acceptable resolution
- **Excellent**: Went above and beyond to fix


## Scoring System

Calculate an execution score by summing points from relevant reviews.
Positive points indicate good execution, negative points indicate issues.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Perfect execution: 10 points
- Good execution: 5 points
- Adequate execution: 0 points
- Minor execution error: -2 points
- Significant execution error: -5 points
- Complete failure: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- Above and beyond resolution (issue resolved exceptionally): +5 points
- Modifications handled perfectly (special requests always correct): +3 points
- Modification ignored (special request not honored): -5 points
- No resolution attempt (issue not addressed): -5 points


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Excellent** if any of the following is true:
- Total score is 500 or higher

**Needs Improvement** if Excellent does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total score is -100 or lower

**Satisfactory** otherwise
