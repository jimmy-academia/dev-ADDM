# Dietary Accommodation Risk Assessment

Help assess the dietary accommodation risk for this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Only firsthand accounts are treated as confirmed evidence. An account is
considered relevant if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:
- requesting accommodation for a dietary restriction (gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian)
- staff response to dietary restriction requests
- incidents where restricted foods were served despite requests
- menu labeling or ingredient transparency

General food preference mentions (e.g., "I like vegan food") are NOT considered
incidents unless they describe an accommodation attempt.

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Restriction Type
Type of dietary restriction

- **Gluten-free**: Gluten allergy, celiac disease, or gluten intolerance
- **Dairy-free**: Dairy allergy, lactose intolerance, or dairy avoidance
- **Vegan**: No animal products (dietary or ethical)
- **Vegetarian**: No meat (may include eggs/dairy)
- **Other**: Other dietary restriction (kosher, halal, keto, etc.)

### Accommodation Level
How well the restaurant accommodated the dietary restriction

- **No accommodation**: Restaurant refused or had no options for the restriction
- **Poor accommodation**: Limited options, mistakes made, or staff seemed annoyed
- **Adequate accommodation**: Basic options available, needs were met
- **Excellent accommodation**: Many options, knowledgeable staff, went above and beyond

### Incident Severity
Severity of any dietary incident that occurred

- **No incident**: No dietary incident described
- **Mild incident**: Wrong ingredient served but caught before eating, or minor discomfort
- **Moderate incident**: Ate restricted food accidentally, noticeable symptoms
- **Severe incident**: Serious health consequences requiring medical attention

### Staff Knowledge
Staff knowledge about ingredients and dietary accommodations

- **No knowledge**: Staff had no knowledge of ingredients or restrictions
- **Poor knowledge**: Staff made incorrect claims or guesses
- **Adequate knowledge**: Staff knew basics, checked with kitchen when unsure
- **Excellent knowledge**: Staff was highly knowledgeable about all ingredients

### Staff Response
How staff responded when the concern was raised

- **Accommodated**: Staff took the concern seriously and successfully accommodated (ingredient check, substitution, separate preparation, clear warnings)
- **Refused**: Staff stated they could not or would not accommodate
- **Dismissive**: Staff minimized the concern or did not take it seriously
- **Not described**: No staff interaction about the concern is described
- **Unknown**: Unclear from the review


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Critical Risk** if any of the following is true:
- 2 or more severe dietary incidents (restricted food served, person got sick) [filter: incident_severity=severe, account_type=firsthand]
- 2 or more reviews report staff providing incorrect ingredient information [filter: staff_knowledge=incorrect, account_type=firsthand]
- 1 or more severe dietary incident with firsthand account [filter: incident_severity=severe, account_type=firsthand]

**High Risk** if Critical Risk does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- 2 or more moderate dietary incidents [filter: incident_severity=moderate, account_type=firsthand]
- 2 or more reviews describe poor accommodation despite clear requests [filter: accommodation_level=poor, account_type=firsthand]
- 2 or more reviews describe staff as unknowledgeable about ingredients [filter: staff_knowledge=unknowledgeable]
- 1 or more reviews describe staff refusing accommodation [filter: staff_response=refused]
- 3 or more reviews describe staff being dismissive [filter: staff_response=dismissive]

**Low Risk** otherwise, especially when:
- No dietary incidents are reported
- Reviews describe knowledgeable staff and successful accommodation
- Menu clearly labels dietary options
