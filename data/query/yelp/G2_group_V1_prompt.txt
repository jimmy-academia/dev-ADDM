# Group Dining Suitability Assessment

Help assess how suitable this restaurant is for group dining (large parties, celebrations, family gatherings)
using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a suitability label: Not Recommended, Acceptable, or Recommended.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- large group dining, parties, celebrations, birthday dinners
- ability to accommodate large parties
- wait times for groups, reservation handling
- check splitting, group service coordination
- family-friendliness (if relevant)

Reviews from solo diners or couples carry less weight unless they comment on observed group experiences.

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Group Size

- **Small (4-6)**: Small group of 4-6 people
- **Medium (7-10)**: Medium group of 7-10 people

### Check Splitting
How easy it was to split the check

- **Refused**: Restaurant would not split the check

- **Great**: Exceptional group experience


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Recommended** if any of the following is true:
- {'text': "At least 1 review describes a 'perfect' group event (birthday, celebration)", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'group_outcome': 'exceptional'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Private room or group menu explicitly praised', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'accommodation_quality': 'excellent'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': "Described as 'great for groups' or 'perfect for parties'", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'accommodation_quality': ['excellent', 'great']}, 'min_count': 1}

**Not Recommended** if Recommended does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- {'text': "At least 1 review describes a group event being 'ruined' by the restaurant", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'group_outcome': 'ruined'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Group was split across multiple tables despite reservation', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'accommodation_quality': ['poor', 'split']}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Refused to accommodate a group or split checks', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'check_splitting': 'refused'}, 'min_count': 1}

**Acceptable** otherwise, especially when:
- Handles groups adequately but not exceptionally
- Suitable for medium groups but struggles with large ones
- Mixed experiences reported
