# Customer Loyalty Assessment

Help assess customer loyalty and retention indicators using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating customer loyalty.
Assign a label: Low Loyalty, Moderate Loyalty, or High Loyalty.

## Definitions of Terms

Reviews from first-time visitors that don't mention return intent carry less weight.

- **Unlikely**: Probably won't return
- **Likely**: Will probably return
- **Definitely**: Will definitely return

## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **High Loyalty** if any of the following is true:
- {'text': "At least 1 review mentions being a 'regular' or '10+ visits'", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'return_intent': 'regular'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Customer returned after bad experience', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'loyalty_driver': 'despite_issues'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': "Described as 'favorite restaurant' or equivalent", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'emotional_connection': 'favorite'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': "Recommendation with strong enthusiasm ('must go', 'best in city')", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'recommend_intent': 'must_go'}, 'min_count': 1}

**Low Loyalty** if High Loyalty does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- {'text': "At least 1 review explicitly says 'never coming back'", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'return_intent': 'never'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Customer warns others not to visit', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'recommend_intent': 'warn_against'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Explicitly switched to competitor', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'loyalty_driver': 'switched_competitor'}, 'min_count': 1}

**Moderate Loyalty** otherwise, especially when:
- Will return but not enthusiastic
- Recommendations with caveats
- No strong emotional connection
