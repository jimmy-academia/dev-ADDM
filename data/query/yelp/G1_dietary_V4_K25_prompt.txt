# Dietary Accommodation Risk Assessment

Help assess the dietary accommodation risk for this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system with recency weighting.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Only firsthand accounts are treated as confirmed evidence. An account is
considered relevant if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:
- requesting accommodation for a dietary restriction (gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian)
- staff response to dietary restriction requests
- incidents where restricted foods were served despite requests
- menu labeling or ingredient transparency

General food preference mentions (e.g., "I like vegan food") are NOT considered
incidents unless they describe an accommodation attempt.

*Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Restriction Type
Type of dietary restriction

- **gluten**: Gluten allergy, celiac disease, or gluten intolerance
- **dairy**: Dairy allergy, lactose intolerance, or dairy avoidance
- **vegan**: No animal products (dietary or ethical)
- **vegetarian**: No meat (may include eggs/dairy)
- **other**: Other dietary restriction (kosher, halal, keto, etc.)

### Accommodation Level
How well the restaurant accommodated the dietary restriction

- **none**: Restaurant refused or had no options for the restriction
- **poor**: Limited options, mistakes made, or staff seemed annoyed
- **adequate**: Basic options available, needs were met
- **excellent**: Many options, knowledgeable staff, went above and beyond

### Incident Severity
Severity of any dietary incident that occurred

- **none**: No dietary incident described
- **mild**: Wrong ingredient served but caught before eating, or minor discomfort
- **moderate**: Ate restricted food accidentally, noticeable symptoms
- **severe**: Serious health consequences requiring medical attention

### Staff Knowledge
Staff knowledge about ingredients and dietary accommodations

- **none**: Staff had no knowledge of ingredients or restrictions
- **poor**: Staff made incorrect claims or guesses
- **adequate**: Staff knew basics, checked with kitchen when unsure
- **excellent**: Staff was highly knowledgeable about all ingredients

### Staff Response
How staff responded when the concern was raised

- **accommodated**: Staff took the concern seriously and successfully accommodated (ingredient check, substitution, separate preparation, clear warnings)
- **refused**: Staff stated they could not or would not accommodate
- **dismissive**: Staff minimized the concern or did not take it seriously
- **none**: No staff interaction about the concern is described
- **unknown**: Unclear from the review


## Scoring System

Calculate a total risk score by summing points from all firsthand dietary incidents,
with recency weighting applied.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Mild incident: 2 points
- Moderate incident: 5 points
- Severe incident: 15 points

Additional modifiers:
- False assurance (incident after staff confirmed food was safe for restriction): +5 points
- Dismissive staff (staff dismissed dietary concern or was rude about request): +3 points
- Medical restriction (restriction is medical (celiac, allergy) rather than preference): +2 points

Recency weighting (reference date: 2022-01-01):
- Within 2 years: full point value
- 2-3 years old: half point value (multiply by 0.5)
- Over 3 years old: quarter point value (multiply by 0.25)


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Critical Risk** if any of the following is true:
- Total risk score is 5 or higher (after recency weighting)

**High Risk** if Critical Risk does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total risk score is 2 or higher (after recency weighting)

**Low Risk** otherwise
