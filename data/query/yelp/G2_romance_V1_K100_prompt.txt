# Romantic Dining Suitability Assessment

Help assess how suitable this restaurant is for romantic dining (dates, anniversaries, proposals)
using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a suitability label: Not Recommended, Acceptable, or Recommended.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- date nights, anniversaries, romantic occasions, proposals
- ambiance, lighting, noise level, privacy
- service style (rushed vs. attentive)
- overall romantic atmosphere

Reviews that only discuss food without mentioning atmosphere carry less weight.
