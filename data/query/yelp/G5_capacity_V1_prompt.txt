# Capacity Management Assessment

Help assess how well this restaurant handles customer volume using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner diagnosing staffing and capacity issues.
Assign a label: Needs Improvement, Satisfactory, or Excellent.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- staffing levels relative to busyness
- how crowded the restaurant was
- whether service suffered when busy
- peak time handling (weekends, holidays)

Reviews that only discuss food quality without mentioning capacity carry less weight.

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Staffing Level
Perceived staffing level relative to customer volume

- **Severely Understaffed**: Far too few staff for customer volume
- **Understaffed**: Noticeably insufficient staff
- **Adequate**: Sufficient staff for the volume
- **Well Staffed**: Plenty of staff, smooth operations

### Crowd Level
How crowded the restaurant was

- **Empty**: Very few or no other customers
- **Moderate**: Normal level of customers
- **Busy**: Restaurant was busy
- **Packed**: Extremely crowded

### Service Degradation
Whether busyness affected service quality

- **None**: Service maintained despite volume
- **Minor**: Slight degradation noticeable
- **Significant**: Clear service decline due to volume
- **Complete**: Service completely collapsed under volume

### Volume Handling
How well they handled customer volume

- **Collapsed**: Could not handle the volume at all
- **Struggled**: Visible difficulty managing volume
- **Managed**: Acceptable handling of volume
- **Handled Well**: Impressed by volume management


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Excellent** if any of the following is true:
- At least 1 review praises handling of extremely busy night- Described as 'well-oiled machine' even when packed- Peak time execution specifically praised
**Needs Improvement** if Excellent does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- At least 1 review describes 'one server for entire restaurant'- Customers left due to overwhelming wait from understaffing- Described as 'chaos' or 'disaster' during busy period
**Satisfactory** otherwise, especially when:
- Adequate handling most of the time- Occasional peak-time struggles- Generally manages volume acceptably
