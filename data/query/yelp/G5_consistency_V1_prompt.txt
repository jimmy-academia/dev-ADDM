## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Excellent** if any of the following is true:
- {'text': "At least 1 frequent customer describes 'never disappoints'", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'reliability': 'always', 'visit_frequency': 'frequent'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Multiple visits described as consistently excellent', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'visit_comparison': 'consistently_excellent'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Long-term regular customer praises maintained quality', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'quality_trend': 'stable', 'visit_frequency': 'long_term'}, 'min_count': 1}

**Needs Improvement** if Excellent does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- {'text': "At least 1 regular customer describes 'went downhill'", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'quality_trend': 'declining', 'visit_frequency': 'regular'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Management change leading to quality decline', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'quality_trend': 'declining'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': "Described as 'coin flip' or completely unpredictable", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'reliability': 'coin_flip'}, 'min_count': 1}

**Satisfactory** otherwise, especially when:
- Generally reliable with occasional variation
- No strong positive or negative trends
- Adequate consistency for most visits
