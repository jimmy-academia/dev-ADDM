# Hygiene and Food Safety Risk Assessment

Help assess the hygiene and food safety risk for this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

considered relevant if it meaningfully discusses any of the following:
- visible cleanliness issues (dirty tables, floors, kitchen, bathroom)
- pest sightings (insects, rodents)
- food safety concerns (hair in food, undercooked, spoiled)
- illness after eating at the restaurant

Vague statements without specific observations (e.g., "seemed clean") carry less weight.

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")

## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Critical Risk** if any of the following is true:
- 2 or more reviews report food poisoning or illness [filter: illness_reported=True, account_type=firsthand]
- 2 or more reviews report pest sightings (roaches, rodents) [filter: issue_type=['pest', 'rodent', 'roach'], account_type=firsthand]
- 1 or more severe hygiene issue reported [filter: issue_severity=severe, account_type=firsthand]

**High Risk** if Critical Risk does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- 2 or more reviews describe major cleanliness issues [filter: issue_severity=major, account_type=firsthand]
- At least 1 review reports food poisoning [filter: illness_reported=True, account_type=firsthand]
- 2 or more reviews describe hair or foreign objects in food [filter: issue_type=['foreign_object', 'hair'], account_type=firsthand]
