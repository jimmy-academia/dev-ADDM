# Customer Loyalty Assessment

Help assess customer loyalty and retention indicators using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating customer loyalty.
Assign a label: Low Loyalty, Moderate Loyalty, or High Loyalty.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system to quantify loyalty.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Reviews from first-time visitors that don't mention return intent carry less weight.

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Return Intent
Intention to return

- **Never**: Will never return
- **Unlikely**: Probably won't return
- **Likely**: Will probably return
- **Definitely**: Will definitely return

### Recommend Intent
Intention to recommend to others

- **Warn Others**: Would warn others to stay away
- **Neutral**: Neither recommend nor warn
- **Recommend**: Would recommend
- **Strongly Recommend**: Would strongly recommend

### Emotional Connection
Emotional attachment to restaurant

- **None**: No emotional connection
- **Low**: Minor positive feeling
- **Moderate**: Noticeable affection
- **High**: Strong emotional connection

## Scoring System

Calculate a loyalty score by summing points from relevant reviews.
Positive points indicate strong loyalty, negative points indicate weak loyalty.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Regular customer: 10 points
- Will definitely return: 5 points
- Might return: 2 points
- Probably won't return: -5 points
- Never returning: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- Strong recommendation (actively tells others to go): +5 points
- Returned after issue (loyalty despite problems): +8 points
- Warns others away (actively discourages visits): -5 points
- Switched to competitor (explicitly left for alternative): -8 points


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **High Loyalty** if any of the following is true:
- Total score is 10 or higher

**Low Loyalty** if High Loyalty does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total score is -5 or lower

**Moderate Loyalty** otherwise, especially when:
- Total score is between -4 and 9
