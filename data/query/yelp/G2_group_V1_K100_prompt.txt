# Group Dining Suitability Assessment

Help assess how suitable this restaurant is for group dining (large parties, celebrations, family gatherings)
using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a suitability label: Not Recommended, Acceptable, or Recommended.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- large group dining, parties, celebrations, birthday dinners
- ability to accommodate large parties

- family-friendliness (if relevant)

Reviews from solo diners or couples carry less weight unless they comment on observed group experiences.
