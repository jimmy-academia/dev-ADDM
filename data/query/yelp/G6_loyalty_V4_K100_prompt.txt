# Customer Loyalty Assessment

Help assess customer loyalty and retention indicators using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating customer loyalty.
Assign a label: Low Loyalty, Moderate Loyalty, or High Loyalty.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system with recency weighting.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- return visits or intention to return
- recommendations to others
- emotional attachment or connection
- loyalty despite issues

Reviews from first-time visitors that don't mention return intent carry less weight.

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Return Intent
Intention to return

- **Never**: Will never return
- **Unlikely**: Probably won't return
- **Likely**: Will probably return
- **Definitely**: Will definitely return

### Recommend Intent
Intention to recommend to others

- **Warn Others**: Would warn others to stay away
- **Neutral**: Neither recommend nor warn
- **Recommend**: Would recommend
- **Strongly Recommend**: Would strongly recommend

### Emotional Connection
Emotional attachment to restaurant

- **None**: No emotional connection
- **Low**: Minor positive feeling
- **Moderate**: Noticeable affection
- **High**: Strong emotional connection

### Loyalty Driver

## Scoring System

Calculate a loyalty score by summing points from relevant reviews,
with recency weighting. Loyalty patterns can shift as restaurants change,
so recent reviews are weighted more heavily.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Regular customer: 10 points
- Will definitely return: 5 points
- Might return: 2 points
- Probably won't return: -5 points
- Never returning: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- Strong recommendation (actively tells others to go): +5 points
- Returned after issue (loyalty despite problems): +8 points
- Warns others away (actively discourages visits): -5 points
- Switched to competitor (explicitly left for alternative): -8 points

Recency weighting (reference date: 2022-01-01):
- Within 6 months: full point value
- 6 months to 1 year: three-quarter point value (multiply by 0.75)
- 1-2 years old: half point value (multiply by 0.5)
- Over 2 years old: quarter point value (multiply by 0.25)


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **High Loyalty** if any of the following is true:
- Total score is 700 or higher (after recency weighting)

**Low Loyalty** if High Loyalty does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total score is 50 or lower (after recency weighting)

**Moderate Loyalty** otherwise
