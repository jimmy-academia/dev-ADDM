# Uniqueness Assessment

Help assess how unique and differentiated this restaurant is using reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating competitive positioning.

Reviews that don't mention distinctiveness or memorability carry less weight.

- **Food**: Unique or standout food
- **Atmosphere**: Unique ambiance or setting
- **Service**: Unique service approach
- **Concept**: Unique restaurant concept
- **Location**: Unique location or view

### Differentiation Level

- **Forgettable**: Nothing memorable about it
- **Average**: Neither memorable nor forgettable

### Signature Item
Whether a must-try signature item exists

## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Highly Unique** if any of the following is true:
- {'text': "At least 1 review describes it as 'only place in the city'", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'differentiation_level': 'only_option'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Described as destination restaurant worth traveling for', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'unique_aspect': 'destination'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': "'Hidden gem' that reviewers don't want to share", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'unique_aspect': 'hidden_gem'}, 'min_count': 1}

**Generic** if Highly Unique does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- {'text': "At least 1 review says 'could be any restaurant'", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'differentiation_level': 'generic'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Described as chain-restaurant quality', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'differentiation_level': 'chain_quality'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'No distinctive features mentioned across reviews', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'unique_aspect': 'none'}, 'min_count': 1}

**Differentiated** otherwise, especially when:
- Some unique elements noted
- Has character but not irreplaceable
- Memorable aspects mentioned
