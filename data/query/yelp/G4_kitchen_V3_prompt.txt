Help assess the kitchen performance at this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
This is from the perspective of a business owner evaluating their kitchen team's execution.
Assign a performance label: Needs Improvement, Satisfactory, or Excellent.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system with recency weighting.

## Scoring System

Calculate a performance score by summing points from relevant reviews,
with recency weighting applied. Chef changes and menu updates mean
recent reviews are more indicative of current quality.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Exceptional food quality: 10 points
- Good food quality: 5 points
- Adequate food quality: 0 points
- Minor food issue: -2 points
- Significant food issue: -5 points
- Inedible food: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- Consistent excellence (same great quality across visits): +5 points
- Creative/unique dishes (chef praised for creativity): +3 points
- Beautiful presentation (plating and presentation praised): +2 points
- Inconsistent quality (hit or miss between visits): -5 points
- Food sent back (dish had to be returned): -3 points

Recency weighting:
- Within 6 months: full point value
- 6 months to 1 year: three-quarter point value (multiply by 0.75)
- 1-2 years old: half point value (multiply by 0.5)
- Over 2 years old: quarter point value (multiply by 0.25) - chef/menu may have changed


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Excellent** if any of the following is true:
- Total performance score is 8 or higher (after recency weighting)

**Needs Improvement** if Excellent does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total performance score is -5 or lower (after recency weighting)

**Satisfactory** otherwise, especially when:
- Total performance score is between -4 and 7
- Recent reviews show improvement in food quality
