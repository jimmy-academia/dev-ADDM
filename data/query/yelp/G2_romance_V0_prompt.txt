# Romantic Dining Suitability Assessment

Help assess how suitable this restaurant is for romantic dining (dates, anniversaries, proposals)
using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a suitability label: Not Recommended, Acceptable, or Recommended.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- date nights, anniversaries, romantic occasions, proposals
- ambiance, lighting, noise level, privacy
- service style (rushed vs. attentive)
- overall romantic atmosphere

Reviews that only discuss food without mentioning atmosphere carry less weight.

### Account Type

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Ambiance Quality
Overall romantic ambiance assessment

- **Poor**: Not romantic at all - bright, loud, unromantic decor
- **Fair**: Some romantic elements but significant drawbacks
- **Good**: Pleasant romantic atmosphere, suitable for dates
- **Excellent**: Exceptional romantic setting, perfect for special occasions

### Noise Level
Noise level affecting intimate conversation

- **Loud**: Difficult to have conversation, must shout
- **Moderate**: Some background noise but conversation is possible
- **Quiet**: Easy to have private conversation
- **Intimate**: Very quiet, perfect for intimate conversation

### Lighting Quality
Lighting appropriateness for romantic dining

- **Harsh**: Bright overhead or fluorescent lighting
- **Neutral**: Standard restaurant lighting, not particularly romantic
- **Dim**: Subdued lighting, romantic feel

Service style appropriateness for romantic dining

- **Rushed**: Staff rush the meal, no time to linger
- **Normal**: Standard service, neither rushed nor especially attentive

## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Recommended** if any of the following is true:
- {'text': 'Multiple reviews describe excellent romantic ambiance', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'ambiance_quality': 'excellent'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Reviews mention successful dates, proposals, or anniversaries', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'date_outcome': 'positive'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Consistently described as quiet, intimate, or romantic', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'ambiance_quality': ['intimate', 'romantic']}, 'min_count': 2}

**Not Recommended** if Recommended does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- {'text': 'Multiple reviews describe loud noise preventing conversation', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'noise_level': 'loud'}, 'min_count': 2}
- {'text': 'Reviews describe harsh lighting or unromantic atmosphere', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'ambiance_quality': ['harsh', 'unromantic']}, 'min_count': 2}

**Acceptable** otherwise, especially when:
