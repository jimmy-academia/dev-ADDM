# Price-Worth Value Assessment

Help assess the value-for-money at this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a value label: Poor Value, Fair Value, or Good Value.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system with recency weighting.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- price perception (expensive, cheap, worth it)
- portion sizes relative to price
- quality relative to price
- deals, happy hours, lunch specials
- overall value assessment

Reviews that only discuss food quality without mentioning price carry less weight.

*Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Price Perception
Perception of value for money

- **Ripoff**: Extremely overpriced, feel cheated
- **Overpriced**: Prices higher than expected for quality
- **Fair**: Prices appropriate for what you get
- **Good Value**: Good quality for the price
- **Steal**: Exceptional value, surprisingly affordable

### Portion Size
Assessment of portion sizes relative to price

- **Tiny**: Portions much too small for the price
- **Small**: Portions smaller than expected
- **Adequate**: Portions are appropriate
- **Generous**: Large, generous portions

### Quality For Price
Food quality relative to cost

- **Poor**: Quality far below what price suggests
- **Fair**: Quality matches price point
- **Good**: Quality exceeds price expectation
- **Excellent**: Premium quality at reasonable price

### Return Intent
Would return based on value assessment

- **Never**: Won't return due to poor value
- **Maybe**: Might return if prices improve
- **True**: Will return, acceptable value
- **Definitely**: Great value, will definitely return


## Scoring System

Calculate a value score by summing points from relevant reviews,
with recency weighting applied. Prices and portions can change significantly,
so recent reviews are weighted more heavily.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Exceptional value (steal): 10 points
- Good value: 5 points
- Fair value: 0 points
- Slightly overpriced: -3 points
- Significantly overpriced: -5 points
- Ripoff: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- Generous portions (portions described as large or generous): +3 points
- Quality exceeds price (food quality better than price suggests): +3 points
- Great deals available (happy hour, lunch specials, or deals praised): +2 points
- Tiny portions (portions described as too small): -3 points
- Quality below price (food quality worse than price suggests): -3 points

Recency weighting (reference date: 2022-01-01):
- Within 6 months: full point value
- 6 months to 1 year: three-quarter point value (multiply by 0.75)
- 1-2 years old: half point value (multiply by 0.5)
- Over 2 years old: quarter point value (multiply by 0.25)


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Good Value** if any of the following is true:
- Total value score is 350 or higher (after recency weighting)

**Poor Value** if Good Value does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total value score is -100 or lower (after recency weighting)

**Fair Value** otherwise
