# Time-Value Assessment

Help assess whether waiting at this restaurant is worth it using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a verdict: Not Worth Waiting, Worth Waiting, or Definitely Worth Waiting.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system with recency weighting.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- wait times for seating, food, or service
- reservations and whether they were honored
- whether the wait was justified by the experience
- willingness to wait again

Reviews that don't mention timing or waiting carry less weight.

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Wait Type
What type of wait occurred

- **Seating**: Wait for a table
- **Food**: Wait for food to arrive
- **Check**: Wait for check/bill
- **Reservation**: Wait despite having reservation

### Wait Duration
How long the wait was

- **No Wait**: Seated or served immediately
- **Short**: Brief wait (under 15 minutes)
- **Moderate**: Moderate wait (15-30 minutes)
- **Long**: Long wait (30-60 minutes)
- **Excessive**: Unreasonably long wait (over 60 minutes)

### Wait Justification
Was the wait justified by the experience

- **Not Worth It**: Wait was not worth the experience
- **Barely Worth It**: Marginal justification for the wait
- **Worth It**: Experience justified the wait
- **Definitely Worth It**: Experience far exceeded expectations, wait was trivial

### Would Wait Again
Would customer wait again for this restaurant

- **Never**: Would not wait again
- **Maybe**: Might wait under certain conditions
- **True**: Would wait again
- **Definitely**: Would definitely wait again


## Scoring System

Calculate a time-value score by summing points from relevant reviews,
with recency weighting applied. Popularity and wait times can change,
so recent reviews are weighted more heavily.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Exceptional - worth any wait: 10 points
- Worth the wait: 5 points
- Neutral/acceptable wait: 0 points
- Wait somewhat not worth it: -3 points
- Definitely not worth waiting: -5 points
- Left due to wait/complete waste: -10 points

Additional modifiers:
- No wait ever (always seated immediately): +3 points
- Reservations honored (reservations work well): +2 points
- Would wait again (reviewer would gladly wait again): +3 points
- Reservations not honored (had reservation but still waited long): +-5 points
- Would not wait again (reviewer explicitly wouldn't wait again): +-3 points

Recency weighting:
- Within 6 months: full point value
- 6 months to 1 year: three-quarter point value (multiply by 0.75)
- 1-2 years old: half point value (multiply by 0.5)
- Over 2 years old: quarter point value (multiply by 0.25) - popularity/wait times may have changed


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Definitely Worth Waiting** if any of the following is true:
- Total time-value score is 8 or higher (after recency weighting)

**Not Worth Waiting** if Definitely Worth Waiting does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total time-value score is -6 or lower (after recency weighting)

**Worth Waiting** otherwise, especially when:
- Total time-value score is between -5 and 7
- Recent reviews show improved wait times
