# Hidden Costs Risk Assessment

Help assess the risk of unexpected charges at this restaurant using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a risk label: Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical Risk.

This assessment uses a point-based scoring system with recency weighting.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- unexpected charges on the bill
- mandatory service charges or auto-gratuity
- corkage fees, split fees, or other surcharges
- bill surprises or lack of price transparency
- fine print charges

Reviews that only discuss food without mentioning billing carry less weight.

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Cost Type
Type of hidden or unexpected cost

- **Service Charge**: Mandatory service charge added to bill
- **Auto Gratuity**: Automatic tip added to bill
- **Corkage Fee**: Fee for bringing own wine
- **Split Fee**: Fee for splitting dishes or checks
- **Other**: Other unexpected charges

### Disclosure Level
How well the hidden cost was disclosed

- **No Disclosure**: Not mentioned until bill arrived
- **Fine Print**: Mentioned in small print on menu
- **Verbal**: Server mentioned it verbally
- **Clear**: Clearly displayed or communicated

### Impact Severity
Impact of hidden cost on total bill

- **Minor**: Small percentage of bill (<5%)
- **Moderate**: Noticeable addition (5-15%)
- **Significant**: Major impact on bill (>15%)

### Customer Reaction
Customer's reaction to the hidden cost

- **Upset**: Very unhappy about undisclosed charges
- **Annoyed**: Mildly annoyed but not deal-breaker
- **Neutral**: Accepted the charge
- **Understanding**: Understood and accepted the charge


## Scoring System

Calculate a risk score by summing points from hidden cost incidents,
with recency weighting. Pricing policies can change, so recent reviews
are weighted more heavily.

For each firsthand incident, assign points based on severity:
- Minor hidden cost (<5% impact): 2 points
- Moderate hidden cost (5-15% impact): 5 points
- Significant hidden cost (>15% impact): 10 points

Additional modifiers:
- No disclosure (charge was not disclosed until bill arrived): +5 points
- Fine print only (charge mentioned only in small print): +3 points
- Multiple hidden charges (more than one type of hidden charge reported): +3 points
- Customer very upset (reviewer expressed strong negative reaction): +2 points

Recency weighting:
- Within 6 months: full point value
- 6 months to 1 year: three-quarter point value (multiply by 0.75)
- 1-2 years old: half point value (multiply by 0.5)
- Over 2 years old: quarter point value (multiply by 0.25) - policies may have changed


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Critical Risk** if any of the following is true:
- Total risk score is 25 or higher (after recency weighting)

**High Risk** if Critical Risk does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- Total risk score is 10 or higher (after recency weighting)

**Low Risk** otherwise
