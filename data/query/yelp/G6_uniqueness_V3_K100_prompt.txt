# Uniqueness Assessment

- Nothing special: -2 points
- Generic/forgettable: -5 points

Additional modifiers:
- Signature dish praised (famous must-try item): +5 points
- Destination restaurant (worth traveling for): +5 points
- Unforgettable experience (truly memorable): +3 points
- Like a chain (described as generic): -5 points
