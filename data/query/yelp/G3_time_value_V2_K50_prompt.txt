# Time-Value Assessment

Help assess whether waiting at this restaurant is worth it using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a verdict: Not Worth Waiting, Worth Waiting, or Definitely Worth Waiting.

## Definitions of Terms

### What to Consider (Guidance)

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- wait times for seating, food, or service
- reservations and whether they were honored
- whether the wait was justified by the experience
- willingness to wait again

Reviews that don't mention timing or waiting carry less weight.

*Note: The above describes what types of content are relevant for this task. It is NOT a field to extract.*

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Wait Type
What type of wait occurred

- **seating**: Wait for a table
- **food**: Wait for food to arrive
- **check**: Wait for check/bill
- **reservation**: Wait despite having reservation

### Wait Duration
How long the wait was

- **none**: Seated or served immediately
- **short**: Brief wait (under 15 minutes)
- **moderate**: Moderate wait (15-30 minutes)
- **long**: Long wait (30-60 minutes)
- **excessive**: Unreasonably long wait (over 60 minutes)

### Wait Justification
Was the wait justified by the experience

- **not_worth_it**: Wait was not worth the experience
- **barely**: Marginal justification for the wait
- **worth_it**: Experience justified the wait
- **definitely_worth_it**: Experience far exceeded expectations, wait was trivial

## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Definitely Worth Waiting** if any of the following is true:
- 20 or more reviews say it was definitely worth the wait
- 25 or more reviews say they would definitely wait again
- 13 or more reviews mention quick service

**Not Worth Waiting** if Definitely Worth Waiting does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- 13 or more reviews describe waits as 'not worth it'
- 9 or more reviews say they would never wait again
- 3 or more reviews describe excessive wait duration
- 5 or more reviews say it was barely worth the wait

**Worth Waiting** otherwise, especially when:
- Reasonable waits for good food
- Some timing issues but overall positive
- Wait acceptable for the type of restaurant
