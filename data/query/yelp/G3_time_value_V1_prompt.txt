# Time-Value Assessment

Help assess whether waiting at this restaurant is worth it using customer reviews as evidence.
Assign a verdict: Not Worth Waiting, Worth Waiting, or Definitely Worth Waiting.

## Definitions of Terms

### Incident

Consider reviews that mention any of the following:
- wait times for seating, food, or service
- reservations and whether they were honored
- whether the wait was justified by the experience
- willingness to wait again

Reviews that don't mention timing or waiting carry less weight.

### Account Type
How the reviewer relates to the described event

- **Firsthand**: The reviewer or their dining party experienced the event directly (e.g., "I had...", "my child...")
- **Secondhand**: The reviewer reports someone else's experience (e.g., "my friend...", "I heard...")
- **Hypothetical**: Concern or preference without describing an actual incident (e.g., "I'm allergic so I worry...")

### Wait Type
What type of wait occurred

- **Seating**: Wait for a table
- **Food**: Wait for food to arrive
- **Check**: Wait for check/bill
- **Reservation**: Wait despite having reservation

### Wait Duration
How long the wait was

- **No Wait**: Seated or served immediately
- **Short**: Brief wait (under 15 minutes)
- **Moderate**: Moderate wait (15-30 minutes)
- **Long**: Long wait (30-60 minutes)
- **Excessive**: Unreasonably long wait (over 60 minutes)

### Wait Justification
Was the wait justified by the experience

- **Not Worth It**: Wait was not worth the experience
- **Barely Worth It**: Marginal justification for the wait
- **Worth It**: Experience justified the wait
- **Definitely Worth It**: Experience far exceeded expectations, wait was trivial

### Would Wait Again
Would customer wait again for this restaurant

- **Never**: Would not wait again
- **Maybe**: Might wait under certain conditions
- **True**: Would wait again
- **Definitely**: Would definitely wait again


## Verdict Rules

A restaurant is considered **Definitely Worth Waiting** if any of the following is true:
- {'text': "At least 1 review describes an hour+ wait that was 'totally worth it'", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'wait_duration': 'very_long', 'wait_justification': 'exceptional'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': "Described as 'would wait any amount of time to eat here again'", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'would_wait_again': 'definitely'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Iconic or destination restaurant where wait is part of the experience', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'wait_justification': 'iconic'}, 'min_count': 1}

**Not Worth Waiting** if Definitely Worth Waiting does not apply, but any of the following is true:
- {'text': 'At least 1 review describes leaving due to wait', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'would_wait_again': 'left'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': 'Reservation not honored with excessive additional wait', 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'wait_type': 'reservation_not_honored', 'wait_duration': 'excessive'}, 'min_count': 1}
- {'text': "Described as 'waste of time' or 'not worth the hassle'", 'type': 'count_threshold', 'filter': {'wait_justification': 'waste'}, 'min_count': 1}

**Worth Waiting** otherwise, especially when:
- Reasonable waits for good food
- Some timing issues but overall positive
- Wait acceptable for the type of restaurant
