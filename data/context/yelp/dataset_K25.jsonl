We ordered to-go both times, and our food was always ready fast and packaged well to avoid any leakage during transportation. \n\nThoughts on the following:\n- Barbecued Shrimp ($25): The BBQ shrimp is a NOLA classic you have to try, though I would say the name is a bit misleading. It didn't taste anything like traditional barbecue. Instead, it had more of an alcoholic/ cooking wine taste to it. It also was buttery, and tangy. I really enjoyed the shrimp.\n\n- Cajun Jambalaya Pasta ($23): This was absolutely life-changing and hands down the best pasta I've ever had. The flavor of this pasta was so unique and it's something I had never tasted before. The fettuccine pasta was tossed in a creamy creole sauce and had bits of alligator and shrimp in it. It was colorful, well-seasoned, and just flawless. Though creamy and flavorful, the pasta didn't feel too heavy. I feel like people don't think about ordering pasta in New Orleans, or at least I certainly did not, but you have to give this a try. \n\n- Crawfish Etouff\u00e9e ($18): the etouffee is a stew with a ball of rice in it and it's topped with bits of crawfish. Winter is not crawfish season, so I was glad to try a bit through the etouffee. Again, the seasoning for anything cajun is just so on point. \n\n- Fried Soft Shell Crab ($8): Gotta have crabs when you're in New Orleans but I actually struggled to find places with fried soft shell crabs. Fortunately, Oceana had it. I just wanted a taste, so I ordered one crab. It came with a cocktail dipping sauce. The crab was so good and had a texture comparable to shrimp tempura. \n\nI had Oceana Grill on my first night in New Orleans and it was a great start to the trip. All these flavors were so new to me and worked so well with every dish. My only complaint is that when you order take-out they give you something like Hawaiian bread instead of toasted baguette slices. Other than that, I loved all the food here and highly recommend it. \n\nTips and Notes:\n- If you order pickup online through their website, there is a slight discount for first-time users. Not sure if this is an ongoing thing, but something to keep in mind. \n- Most of the regular dishes had appetizer/ smaller sized dishes for you to taste and try. So, if you're overwhelmed and don't know what to get, you can get tons of mini dishes.", "date": "2022-01-13 18:26:47", "user": {"name": "Joy", "review_count": 6, "yelping_since": "2016-12-10 23:46:09", "elite": "", "average_stars": 4.67, "fans": 0}}, {"review_id": "pzJvypqo3h5p1l7aNQFKFQ", "user_id": "KnpapmrTcvXhq_Sl_FmkMA", "business_id": "ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I decided to order the Blackened Chicken Platter and it did not disappoint.

Highly regarded Cajun cuisine that works with local farms for a large amount of their ingredients. Menu, though not extensive, looked great before our arrival so was looking very forward to our meal. I would consider it on the pricy side, though maybe not for New Orleans. Very personable service throughout our time here. Once seated we ordered drinks and perused the menu. A bowl of delicious rolls with butter arrived shortly. Having just gotten off a plane and not being all that hungry, along with being budget conscious, we chose to order light. Wife ordered the bacon and pork pie and the cucumbers and herbs in vinegar salad. My choices were the chicken & andouille sausage gumbo along with fried alligator with chili garlic mayo. The pork pie was a bit light on flavor-lacking any discernible seasoning or bacon flavor. More bacon would add a lot. The crust was well made and it was cooked perfectly. Cucumber salad had a large amount, IMO, of red chili flakes not listed on the menu. Avoiding them was difficult but she powered through it, pronouncing it \"fine\". My gator was delicious, tasting very fresh and lightly breaded. But for me, as I was expecting, the chili mayo was too much for my palate. Very small bits of sauce added to the flavor but it was easy to add too much. The gumbo was the star of the show for me. Deep, rich flavor profile along with tender veggies and sausage that was flavorful without being too hot. I should really have ordered more of this.\n\nI didn't pay as much attention to our companions' meals as I should have but I did try a bite of the wood fired gulf fish served \"fishermen's\" style that on our visit was redfish. Requested grilled, it had a great seasoning and was very reminiscent, IMO, of a fresh trout, though the person who ordered it compared it to halibut. I didn't think so.  Desserts were a German Chocolate Pie and an Apple Cider donut. The donut was pronounced flavorful by our fellow diners but I never tried it as I was fully involved in our pie. I will say it was not really like a pie IMO as the texture was very firm, not soft and moist like a traditional pie. It resembled to me more of a pecan pie with chocolate and coconut or a 7-layer bar for those who know what those are. Very very good. A really enjoyable meal.

Wait time for indoors will vary from 30 mins or more and outdoor seating will be from 1 hour or more. Best to make reservation in advance if possible. We decided to just visit this sought out establishment and take our chances. \n\nWe arrived and found parking in the nearby Armature Works Parking lot, available all day for $10. You can take your chances on street parking but it requires some waiting and perseverance because it is PACKED!! $10 is worth the time! \n\nGot to the restaurant and placed our name on the wait list. What was said over the phone is entirely correct. Our outdoor seating will be a 1 hour wait. \n\nMoments later, after visiting the nearby River Walk Trails and checking out the nearby shops at the Armature Works, our 1 hour wait for our walk-in for outdoor seating was honored. \n\nAfter we got the text that our table was ready, our receptionist seated us immediately and our server, Ms. Taylor, greeted us to some water and prepared our menus and napkin kit. \n\n\nINDOOR Seating:\n-- 15 Tables seating up to 5/6 Upstairs\n-- 20 Tables seating up to 5/6 Downstairs\n-- Better to reserve in advance; otherwise wait can be 30 minutes or more\n\nOUTDOOR Seating:\n-- 19 Tables with up to 5 seats\n-- 16 Barstools for the expanded outdoor bar area (first come first serve)\n-- Walk-ins wait can be 1 hour or more (even on Mondays, according to our server)\n\nAfter sitting down and water already provided, we ordered two glass of Blancs de' Blancs Sparkling Wine and two order of Appetizers to start our evening off:  A Dozen of Char-boiled Oysters, Seared Fresh Sea Scallops. \n\nFor our main entr\u00e8, we ordered the Seafood Risotto and the 1 LB Crackling Pork Shank. \n\nThe appetizers came out no more than 10 minutes after we placed the ordered. 15 minutes into the appetizers ALL tasting superb and fabulously-tasty, the main dishes came out. Man, what a great customer service and cooking experts at this place. The great things we've heard on YouTube reviews by the locals were spot on correctly described. \n\nThe oysters were so fresh and yummy, not chewy. \nThe seared scallops were so tender and fresh as if it wasn't even seared. Melts in the mouth like butter. The Seafood Risotto was probably the best dish we've had. Rice parley with shrimp, lobster , scallops and veggies tasted amazing. The rice was a bit salty but a squeeze of lemon did the trick. The pork shank was meaty and mighty delicious and full of BBQ flavor from meat to bones. The meat fell off the bones and simply melt in your mouth like butter! \n\nI'm recommending this place for other locals and tourist alike or even for foodie reviewers like myself.  \n\nWait can be a THING for people but if you dare to wait, I promise the food is fabulous!!", "date": "2022-01-02 23:38:18", "user": {"name": "Lee", "review_count": 102, "yelping_since": "2015-11-11 17:11:41", "elite": "2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.59, "fans": 13}}, {"review_id": "v57qIjypKLPmUcCXUFHURA", "user_id": "sSbqHGnfbqC5L-dGL66xHQ", "business_id": "L5LLN0RafiV1Z9cddzvuCw", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "The food is pretty good.

The Dry-Aged Ribeye literally melts in your mouth. It was a great quality cut of Rib-eye. It was soft and tender, not overly seasoned. It was cooked medium rare and to perfection! The Chocolate Kanafi was phenomenal! The cake was made up of fried coconuts with a rich dark chocolate and pistachio ganache on the inside. The pistachio ganache was a perfect sweet compliment to the chocolate! \n\nEverything was delicious! I wish I could have eaten more, but each dish seemed salty.

It was founded by head chef Michael Solomonov and his business partner Steven Cook. Solomonov was born in G'nei Yehuda, Israel and raised in Pittsburgh. At the age of 18, he returned to Israel with no Hebrew language skills, taking the only job he could get -working in a bakery- and his culinary career was born. At Zahav (Hebrew for \"gold\"), Solomonov weaves together the culinary traditions of immigrants to Israel from all over the world with the ancient foodways of Arabia and the Levant. The cooking at Zahav comes from a deep well of Israeli hospitality. \n\nMy wife and I ate at Zahav in April 2015 during our 4-day sightseeing trip to Philadelphia. Zahav is one of Philadelphia's most popular restaurants. It is so popular that I was only able to get a reservation at 9PM on a Sunday night. After scanning the menu, we decided to order the 'Taste or Zahav' experience where you get to try a little bit of everything. Up first was the Salatim course: six different small plates of Israeli vegetable salads (lots of pickled/marinated veggies). Then we had delicious Laffa bread with hummus. The Mezze course consisted of crispy Haloumi, house-smoked sable, fried fingerling potatoes and crispy chicken. For entrees, I had the Duck Kebab and my wife had the Chicken Shishlik. For dessert, I had the Israeli Ice Cream Sandwich and my wife had the Pear Sorbet. This was easily one of the best dining experiences we ever had!

If you are a host or hostess and you are booked up, at least let people know there is a bar they can try for. We walked here from our hotel as a last minute decision, and the host basically tried to turn us away. Said \"we're booked you'll have to try again another night.\" I walked right past him and saw 2 seats at the bar. He was surprised I even asked to sit down, like \"O no you did it wrong try again.\" Just rude man. Not the way to be. Started the night off WAY behind.\n\nThe bartender we ordered from was cool, but super short. He was not super busy either. I would ask about dishes, and he would give the most minimal answer. Once he realized I was just curious he started opening up. It's unfortunate when the service almost ruins the experience.\n\n\nAs for the food, they did bring bread, and it was kind of warm, and was good, but nothing to rave about. The guy said they were known for the crab meat cheesecake. I have had one before so I went for it. It was good but not great. The sauce to accompany it was tasty, but nowhere near enough of a crab taste, and the cheesecake was not set enough either. More meat, cooked a bit longer, and it would be amazing. That's just my opinion. \n\nBeing in NO we had to get gumbo, and the turtle soup I thought was unique. Both dishes were above average. Spot on, extremely good. Only issue was the size of the order was not asked, and for a bowl of soup, it seemed like a very small amount.\n\nOverall, the really great soup made this place average for me.

It's kind of like fast food in an upscale setting - The food must be pre-prepared and ready to go, so if your cocktails are at all delayed, as our were, your food and cocktails arrive at the same time.  Portions are generally excessive, and we took home enough for another whole meal. The salad on the side is gorgeous and better than I remember. So refreshing with shredded jicama, bell pepper, and grapes! The tortilla portion however, wasn't adequate (4 corn tortillas total), and since our server never came to ask how we were doing, we weren't able to request more tortillas.  We love to cloak our meat and sauce in a nice warm tortilla. My husband asked for hot sauce and got instead minced fresh, salted jalape\u00f1os! Yum! \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the warm chocolate cake with bananas, which was excessive in size. It was also excessive in price. The prices on the dinner menus are clearly noted on the chalkboard, but if he had told us it was actually a dessert suitable to serve four people and it was $15, we would've declined. Chef- why not offer a smaller portion?  Coffee was just ok, and the waiter forgot the sugar requested, and again since he never checked on us.....\n\nWe were a table of two and our server had perhaps seven tables, many of them 4-6 tops.

The food came quickly but I was quite shocked at the small entree sizes. I barely got a serving spoon size of the carne asada which was tasteless, a small serving of chicken and a big spoonful of corn pudding (which was the vegetarian item on the Menu). The vibrant salad, which took up nearly half of the plate, was simply a huge pile of lettuce leaves, red cabbage, a slice of cucumber and a small, thin slice of cantaloupe.

Tallulas Garden, at Washington Square is the fifth Starr Restaurant in my series, and the second collaboration with Starr and Aimee Olexy in my series so far, (See The Love). I found a single seat at the bar, and met my two servers Greg, and Whitney. The U-shaped bar was kind of small, with about ten stools around it... It was especially small behind the bar! Those two kids had about as much room as a pool table! Serving all the patrons at the bar, both seated and standing and getting the drinks for the large wait staff... They were incredible! It was like watching a ballet! It amazed me how they never seemed to get in each other's way! After viewing the cocktail menu, I decided on The Winemaker, Talula's fall spiced pear sangria...crisp white wine, Brandy & orchard fruit. YUM !!!  I started with Creamy Corn Grits, 'caramel sea salt butter'. They were thick FRESH and tasty! They were the consistency of oat meal... The flavor of fresh corn was dominant with the faint flavors of caramel sneaking in. I then had the Kennett Mushroom Omelet, brandied onion and herb roasted mushrooms, Gruy\u00e8re cheese, crispy potatoes and greens... I ordered it with extra cheese...It didn't come that way. It was very good and the eggs were PERFECT ! Whie there may have been enough cheese for the average person, I think it would have been MUCH better with more cheese...The potatoes were dusted with what I suspect was a combination of paprika, cumin, cayenne pepper and other spices they call Brunch potato spice. They were cooked perfect and had a unique flavor.

The aged manchego cheese definitely proved to be the star of the night: the subtle hint of truffle lavender in the honey paired beautifully with the cheese and set a wonderful precedent for the rest of the night. For entrees, we both settled on the hanger steak (amazing!), paella (just ok), and spanish octopus (another favorite!!). Finally, we ended with their Spanish cheesecake and Catalan xiuxiu (a puff pastry filled with chocolate over apricot jam). Usually I'm not a fan of dessert, but I have to say these hit the spot. The cheesecake had a citrus kick that I loved while the chocolate in xiuxiu was also very yummy without being overbearingly sweet.

Creamy a little sweet and savory,  Served with a delicious fresh loaf of bread.  A definite winner.\n\nThe Dan Dan noodles.  Tasty and a bit spicy.  However similar dishes at many asian restaurants far surpass this.\n\nMushroom Carpacio.  I appreciate what the chef was trying to do.  The meaty texture of the mushroom was used to simulate the traditional beef dish.  While the chewiness is similar, the lack a fat ultimately has this dish fall short.\n\nGrilled Carrot.  Delicious, smoky, sweet and tender.  I have however done this dish at home many times to similar effect.  The dish was served with easily the best farro that I have ever had.  Perfectly cooked, rich and creamy.  I could  have easily eaten a whole bowl.\n\nEggplant.  If I was not told I would never have known.  The texture is more like sausage.  Tasty, light, and satisfying.\n\nFingerling Potatoes.  Nicely cooked and spiced.  Crispy but not dry.  Excellent but not better than many other restaurants.\n\nThe service was good, and the restaurant had a cozy ambiance.  \n\nIn short if you are a vegetarian, it does not get much better than this.

AND NO sauce.  just the same horrible sandwich, bad toppings with the mushy bad tomato.  it needed something - anything to cover the flavor.   We were so hoping for some sweet crab.  I will say - the french fries had some salt and pepper and were pretty good.  Little crisper and they would have made up for the tomato.   Our server though was very nice.

After careful research online I let out a big sigh and booked a reservation for Morimoto. A back story on us is we like great food but at an affordable price so Morimoto being at its price point is something we would've never even thought about it. Firstly, when you walk in the ambience of the restaurant is simply stunning and breathtaking. It's a unique and modern look with slowly changing LED lights that set the mood. I ordered the \"South Pacific\" drink, a calpico soda with pineapple and cilantro from the non-alcoholic menu and it was very light and refreshing! For appetizer, we wanted something unique so we got the wagyu hot stone which is a cook at your table dish in which they put a hot stone in the oven and it comes to you very very hot and you cook it yourself at your table with the instruction of the employee. We had never had Wagyu this buttery soft and delicious and wish we could experience it all over again. I mean just WOW!! We ordered the $90 chef's combination for dinner which comes with sashimi, sushi, and sushi rolls. Initially, we were planning on getting two cause we do enjoy feasting but opted out to only getting one and getting more later if we were still hungry. The flavors were absolutely out of this world and nothing we've experienced before. I don't know how many times we said \"this place is expensive for a reason\" but it was so so worth it and just absolutely melt in your mouth. The portion was also very reasonably sized in which we didn't have to order more afterwards. For dessert, again going on the theme with unique, we ordered the fiery chocolate, that is essentially flourless chocolate cake with meringue, raspberry ice cream, bits of pomegranate encased in a chocolate ball that they light on fire using alcohol. It was so fun and pretty to watch and even more delicious especially the cake. Overall, I would highly recommend this place to everyone to at least openly consider and experience.

The tuna tartare was perfectly seasoned. The Hamachi ponzu was probably the best appetizer dish. It has a nice kick with the jalape\u00f1o, but the ponzu really helped balance it out. The Wasabi rice was also fantastic and not as spicy as you would think.\n\nDinner we got a Chef's Combo ($90), Black Cod Miso, Australian Wagyu Filet, and a Sukiyaki Udon. I was here with a party of 6 so two orders of the Chef's Combo was perfect with nothing left on the trays. The Black Miso Cod was PHENOMENAL and so flavorful and tender.

The first bite truly surprised us.\nSushi - 5/5, we ordered maguro, chu-toro, o-toro, and uni, all of which was of really high quality.\n\nI would recommend this place and would totally come back, but unfortunately it does lean on the pricer side.", "date": "2021-10-26 02:17:59", "user": {"name": "Andrew", "review_count": 169, "yelping_since": "2016-06-04 00:51:49", "elite": "2018,2019,2021", "average_stars": 3.99, "fans": 5}}, {"review_id": "chgTrg7P9nkO-dLN6rXKdQ", "user_id": "wo8mvtL0eJ2pnnmMfJM03Q", "business_id": "6_T2xzR74JqGCTPefAD8Tw", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Ordered for dinner last night via caviar and food was delivered hot and arrived quickly, but that's the only good thing I can say.

The tuna tartare - one of my favorites- fatty toro and perfect wasabi sauce.

Like all chef-ish food, the various courses were full of confusing and mysterious ingredients, yet so delicious that I did not care whatsoever whether I knew what the f*** I was eating.\n\nThe omokase is seven courses; they also brought out a wee little amuse-bouche in between somewhere. The whole experience took about 2 hours -- if you choose to do this meal, just leave plenty of time. Obviously Honey and I passed the evening gazing adoringly at each other. \n\nRather than rhapsodize about every course, I will just deal with the sushi course which was at the very end. It was five pieces of sushi, and they were small and slender in the more traditional old-school style. If you are a nerd and want to learn more about that, I recommend you watch the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi. It is adorable. So the waiter told us to eat the sushi in order from left to right. And we did. The first piece, a tuna which had some sort of intense flavor added to it, was so incredibly good that I burst into tears. I pulled myself together and continued on the flavor journey, and then the last piece, freshwater eel, was again so good that I burst into tears again. \n\nOne note about the sushi: the rice was the absolute best sushi rice I have ever had anywhere. Not too sweet or vinegar-y, gently clinging together in a nice shape but not gummy or sticky, not overcooked even a tiny bit. As I chewed the little morsels, I could feel the texture of each grain of rice in my mouth. Astounding! When I mentioned this to the waitress she smiled and replied that they polish the rice themselves by hand in the kitchen. Which is pretty much the all-time most high-dollar chef-tastic thing I have ever heard.\n\nI was so love-drunk on that food that I can't truly recall whether it would have good handicap access. It should be fine for anyone who's up on two legs with crutches or a walker. Not sure about a wheelchair. It's in Philly near the busy Penns' Landing area so parking will be a bit intense. Honey and I walked over from our hotel.\n\nSo. Uh.

I'm a big texture person so that's a plus in my book. \n\n- [General Tso Soup Dumpling]: The flavor was good but mild in comparison to the umami flavors you can find in a Dim Sum Garden soup dumpling. \n\n- [Crispy Rock Shrimp*]: Hands down the BEST rock shrimp I've ever had. It tasted so fresh and the addition of the radish gave a pleasant additional texture and tart flavor.\n\nWould I go back? : I'm not sure.

And, while it's not cheap, the food you get is largely worth the cost.  Where they get you is on alcohol (which is a little overpriced) and on all the little toppers and accessories for your steak (which are hideously overpriced).\n\nI got the grass fed Delmonico (Ribeye), cooked rare.  First of all, it's one of the uh...\"rare\" steaks that  I've gotten that is actually cooked this way.  Second of all it was good, but not great.  I'm not a steak expert, but after reading 10-12 paragraphs about their steak process...I was just expecting more.  Despite all their verbiage about aggressively cutting away fat, this was a pretty fat ribeye.  I'm the type of person/weirdo that enjoys eating chunks of pure fat on his ribeye and...I left a lot of chunks of fat on the plate.\n\nI love that the steak also comes with everything.  Too many restaurants now serve everything ala cart, and charge you for every little side. The steak here came with soup and salad.  When the steak comes out, it's served with a loaded baked potato and the veggie of the day.  (it was green beans for us)  Everything was good, except for the potato (which wasn't bad, it was fine, just nothing special).  Save room in your stomach for everything else!\n\nAfterwards, we went to the \"dessert room\".  In my head I always thought this was like...a walk-in cooler where you point at the dessert you want.  I could not have been more wrong!\n\nThe Dessert Room is an entirely different restaurant and, in my opinion, a much better one that the steakhouse.  The ambiance here is incredible.  Every table is encased in it's own isolating structure, and they seem to go on forever, like some kind of low-lit labyrinth.  Some of them are apparently RED WOOD (yes, those Redwoods)  wine casks...which I didn't know were a thing.  How delightfully opulent!  I'm not big into dessert, but I loved the offerings on the dessert menu.  Everything was unique and made from scratch.\n\nThe service is very good, but very different that most restaurants.  They will make you feel like you're a mob boss, no matter who you are.  If you're into that, you'll love it!\n\nWill I be back?  Probably not.\n\nAm I glad I finally made it?  Hell yes!\n\nShould you go?  Depends.  If you're into desserts...this will probably be the best place you've ever been to!

It took me some time because I am in mourning.  The Bern's I knew and loved so much has truly changed.\n\nFour of us went for dinner, a special occasion, after landing a reservation which required a call 90 days in advance.  90 days.   We arrived early and offered to give up our hard-won table for some seats in the bar because we love the bar.   We were told no.  Absolutely not.   No?  No!   I had never heard that word before at Bern's, which always did whatever it could to make its diners happy, right down to finding okra somewhere when I mentioned how much I love it.   That \"no\" created a ripple in the Matrix.\n\nSo....we found ourselves in the front dining room (not our favorite dining room) with a nice but less experienced Captain.   We ordered drinks and the caviar tasting to get things going, followed by wine and a variety of steaks.  \n\nThe Caviar tasting options were quite good, making the tasting itself a true value, but I missed the Bern's butters...long gone now with Bern himself.  We  had to ask for more toasts, which took a bit of time to arrive.  Our drinks arrived sporactically as well.  \n\nWe moved somewhat clumsily through the soup and salad courses.  The salads are still served with wonderful housemade dressings including French, something I don't come across often.  You can no longer choose between salads.  House is it.  Anything else is extra.  \n\nThe days of soup choices are also long gone.  French onion is what you get.   I opted for the vichysoisse even though I had to pay extra for something that used to be part of the meal.  I love Bern's vichysoisse and as good as the french onion soup may be, the vichysoisse wins with its caviar and truffle oil topping and its housemade chips.   \n\nThe moment when my love affair with Bern's changed arrived with the steaks.  Bern's always made a great steak, served on a sizzling platter, with butter still melting on top if you so desired.  Alongside the steak, crispy onion strings, a vegetable grown on Bern's farm and amaretto carrots.  Always amaretto carrots.  Until this night.   Our Captain said they were no longer serving them.\n\nMy steak was very good, but no Bern's great.  It was closer to medium than medium rare.  No butter once again.  I received a baked potato with toppings on the side.  The fantastic onion strings were there, a few (4-5) green beans but no amaretto carrots.  No carrots?   How could there be no amaretto carrots?   They are, make that were, a Bern's signature.\n\nThe fresh fish tanks are gone.  The soup and salad courses are set. No choices.  The little extras are no more.  The service isn't quite as precise.  Even the wine cellar feels a little lost.  I chalk so much of this up to the pandemic.  And yet, it was the missing carrots that caused me to pause.\n\nI know that restaurants have to evolve with time.  It just feels as if Bern's is eliminating rather than evolving.   It made me sad to sit in Berns with so many of the things I loved about it now gone or an pricey upcharge.   I had to spend some time reconciling this.   Bern's still offers you a very good meal for a very good price in an eccletic environment typically served by a well-trained efficient staff.   It is far better option than any steakhouse chain in America.   I just mourn the loss of the good old days when it didn't say \"no\" and you were offered you so much more, including those distinctive perfect-with-steak amaretto carrots.", "date": "2021-12-23 03:36:53", "user": {"name": "Katherine", "review_count": 103, "yelping_since": "2011-12-26 02:41:41", "elite": "2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 3.72, "fans": 4}}, {"review_id": "UnX3JpoQJLBFTrFT-_1HPQ", "user_id": "m-dorx_bFnzr0hd0Lr1EDg", "business_id": "dsfRniRgfbDjC8os848B6A", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This is a staple in Tampa.

I grabbed myself 6 of the oysters, and i was in love. i loved them so much, i convinced the guy next to me to get them. they were greasy, garlicy, and loaded with cheese.\n\nin true fat pig form, i grabbed an order of gator bites too. i highly suggest these if you wanna be adventurous and try something else besides the oysters. they were outstanding. probably one of the best gator bites i had. they were fresh, fried perfectly, and i liked that the batter didnt over power the gator itself. i didnt even need the sauce it came with. \n\nalthough i love dragos oysters, i think theyre the 2nd best in town, which sucks since they are known to create these amazing lil suckers. i highly suggest coming here, especially since its huge, no lines, and great service. try for yourself and let me know!", "date": "2021-12-06 15:45:23", "user": {"name": "Desiree", "review_count": 1401, "yelping_since": "2012-11-10 16:04:48", "elite": "2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 3.89, "fans": 220}}, {"review_id": "cHjdHVaZomDqtTWbVkivpA", "user_id": "ztBZpfNxrrhyiPPKzhqNTQ", "business_id": "DcBLYSvOuWcNReolRVr12A", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "First time I had oyster & these were good.

A well kept secret, Restaurant R'evolution a great gem in the heart of the quarter half a block off of Bourbon connected via courtyard to The Royal Sonesta.

Once led to our table, our servers J and Isaac took very good care of us. Every dish from appetizer to dessert was delicious and well executed.

I couldnt give 5 stars due to the hostess who we all found rude and unprofessional when interacting with us upon arrival and while asking questions regarding our seating.

The restaurant opened at 5:00 since it was a Sunday evening. I'm not sure if she was having a rough day or if it was her general demeanor but it put a bad taste in our mouths. Luckily excellent staff as Jeralyn (hope I'm spelling that right) and Isaac were as phenomenal as they are. They more than made up for our initial welcome. Also, the seating could use an update. Though comfortable, the mid century styled seating had some wear on the seat's \"leather\" for the arm rests and actual seats. Other than that, great food and drinks.

Then, Da'Shawn hands us the cocktail menus and a separate wine menu that's on an in-house iPad with searchable features by country, region, price, or any other filtering you might need. We decide on the Saintsation and the Lower Garden and they're good enough to order more throughout the meal. Spread out over the next three hours, we get the free house cornbread to start, one serving more crispy and another cooked to perfection and both served with a choice of olive oil, sea salted butter, or sweet butter with cane syrup. Try a little of each topping with the bread because they each provide a little something different. Then, we started with the Turtle Soup with Deviled Eggs and the Blue Crab Beignets. The beignets have been a return try because they converted a non-seafood me to like crab cakes and a whole world of food. The turtle soup was different from anything we've had and meshed well with the deviled egg, but we were split on whether this was worth an order again or just an interesting bite. The main meal came when Da'Shawn told us we could have half-portions of the pastas, so we ordered a half of the Duck Confit Ravioli and the Lobster Gnudi. Both were mouth-watering, with a standout in the filling for the Duck Ravioli, but the best were our meat entrees. We got the 8-oz Center Filet with truffle butter and foie gras and the special, a 16-day Ages Rack of Lamb with a red-wine reduction and a lobster tail on top. The steak stands on its own, but is even better with the truffle butter and the lamb was delicious. After a full meal, our dessert stomachs were satiated with Espresso Martinis each and a Bananas Foster Affogato Trifle.

This review will highlight the food from my most recent trip to NOLA in October of 2021.\n\nMeal 1\n\nI started with the Yellowfin Tuna Crudo w/Alligator Pear, Red Onion, Ginger, Radish, Shaved Apple\nFor those who know me or have read other reviews, I'm a sucker for crudo and this did not disappoint. The stand out here was actually the completeness of the dish. The fish was velvety in texture, fresh and delicately delicious. The pear, red onion, ginger, radish, and shaved apple did not over power but instead offered a wonderful contrast in texture and flavors that resulted in complete harmony on the palate. \n\nMy husband started with dry-aged steak tartare w/cured egg yolk, pickled shallot, black garlic mustard, and house made fingerling chips.\nHe raved about this dish...and I say for good reason.  I did have a taste and found it to be a powerhouse of a starter.  How raw beef can be so darn tender is a mystery. The mustard brought zing along with the pickled shallot while the egg yolk contributed to the creaminess of the creation. The crunch of the house made chips countered what could have been a redundant texture but saved the day to make this a complex and satisfying starter.\n\nNext for both of us:  Death by Gumbo\nI'd had this dish on a previous visit to Restaurant R'evolution and it is why I returned. I have much love for this dish. The gumbo is intense.....and it is certainly not traditional.  The presentation is interesting as well.  A covered bowl is placed before me....then the cover is lifted to reveal a single quail that has been deboned and stuffed with yummy things....(rice, sausage, etc.).  Then the strained \"gumbo\" liquid is poured from a small little pitcher over the quail, coating it with pure intensified flavor. Gah. So good. That quail has a crispy skin and the meat is tender and delicious.  The fillings bring the comforting flavor of dirty rice and sausage expertly combined to make one composed exquisite bite. I seriously wanted to lick the bowl.\n\nEntree - we split something that was not on the menu (sorry) but I'll do my best to describe the dish. I want to mention, though, how much we appreciate the care the chef took in making sure we both had a perfectly composed dish.  We each had a bit of all components:  seared scallops, foie gras, duck confit ravioli, and micro greens in a delicate broth.  Outstanding.  It was balanced in flavors and textures.  I am pretty certain had we each ordered it we would not have been able to finish but divided between us it was the perfect amount for tasting. The dish was exciting, interesting, and entertaining....food peeps, you'll get that.  Sorry if that sounds like food-snobbery. Shake it off.\n\nDessert, which is a priority of mine, was next on my agenda.\n1. Louisana citrus doberge w/Meyer Lemon Curd, Creole Cream Cheese Ice Cream, Honeycomb\nThere is that doberge cake again!  (Referencing another review) The stand out for this dessert was the meyer lemon curd because it brought moisture and pucker to what could have been a cake a smidge on the dry side....the cream cheese ice cream was my husband's fave and the honeycomb was a lovely addition. \n2. Burnt honey ice cream.  My husband ordered this and it was ME who fell in love with it. The salt on top made me want more and more.  I loved the sweet/seemingly caramel flavor of the cream, too.....and just when you think you've had enough, the salt kicks in and you crave another nibble. They know what they are doing.\n\nAt the conclusion of this meal, my husband pulled out his phone and cancelled the reservations he made at another place for the next night and reserved a table for us at Restaurant R'evolution again.  Soooo if you are interested in knowing what we had for meal deux, I'm happy to send it your way. It was charcuterie night!

We all ordered a drink, appetizers, and a couple of us shared multiple appetizers or entrees. The waiter (bald older man) kept trying to push the $60 per person tasting menu on us- which, while it seems amazing, isn't what we were looking for on our medical school student budgets- we wanted nice food, but not quite that pricy.\n\nAfter we ordered the waiter was clearly irritated we hadn't ordered more and proceeded to ignore our table the remainder of the night. He went and took drink orders and refilled the water at the two large party tables beside us (twice) but ignored us  completely and never refilled our water after we put our order in (probably at least an hour). The previous hour while we'd had drinks and waited for our friend this had not been the case. We would have liked to have order more drinks, but after being ignored for that long decided not to and to just get the check because we were tired of the staff looking down their noses at us. \n\nIn addition to that, the food was far from original in my opinion, and nothing to justify the price point. Sure some of the appetizers were unique, and the duck was delicious, but I don't think they were any better than what I've had at any other Philly dim sum restaurant or Asian fusion restaurants (and was considerably more expensive). I'd save your money and go elsewhere for dim sum, and there are any number of nicer restaurants at this price point that actually care to cater to and be nice to their customers regardless of how much they spend.

I asked Pete if he could recommend a specialty cocktail to start off with. I told him I had a preference for vodka. Pete made me a Vesper Martini. I wouldn't normally order a Martini, but since it came highly recommended I decided to give it a try ! I looked on the menu for a description, but it was not there...\"Oh no\" Pete said, \"That is MY specialty cocktail\"  I later did some research on the drink and found the drink was invented and named by Ian Fleming in the 1953 James Bond novel Casino Royale and made with Vodka, Gin and Kina Lillet. It was very smooth...For starters I ordered, Lobster Egg Rolls, shrimp, Thai basil, chili sauce. again I asked Pete to recommend a wine for my Lobster Egg Rolls... A Chenin Blanc from coastal South Africa was what Pete suggested. . . It was a  bit dry and a worked VERY well with my appetizer ! The two Lobster Egg Rolls were stuffed with an ample amount of lobster and the sauce accompanying them was just as perfect as the wine ! For my entr\u00e9e (I regret I lost the picture) I ordered, Sweet & Crispy Jumbo Shrimp, citrus-radish salad, candied walnuts. The several large shrimp were beautifully presented down the center of on an oblong plate like the egg rolls with a candied walnut and hot red pepper slice on each side !  I cut all the ingredients in half and had shrimp, pepper and walnut in each bite ! WOW !!! Pete's' wine recommendation for this course was a Sauvignon blanc from Sileni Estates. It was a bit sweeter than the Chenin Blanc and  AGAIN was perfect with my food !!! Kudos to Pete for his vast knowledge and passion for both the menu and the wines...I highly recommend Buddakan, and will be back to explore some more !     https://buddakan.com/?", "date": "2021-10-30 02:04:19", "user": {"name": "Thomas", "review_count": 38, "yelping_since": "2017-12-02 02:19:55", "elite": "2021", "average_stars": 4.89, "fans": 1}}, {"review_id": "vvjQl6t2OzErvTPvQBL6-A", "user_id": "lpqFdMzNe-kRY0RX9cSyXw", "business_id": "nIAbuktMEzVjT4P9pG89rQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "The atmosphere in here was 10/10 such a great girls night, date night or fun night with friends spot!

To start, my waiter, Anthony, was a delight. So friendly and personable (even behind a mask). I'm so glad I was seated in his section.\n\nThe food was phenomenal. I started with the edamame dumplings, which were so smooth and creamy. They were a little one note for me, but they were still good. The General Tso's dumplings however, were an absolute religious experience. They came out piping hot and I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but the filling is savory with a sweet and tangy broth. I would've liked a proper soup dumpling spoon, but I did fine just putting the whole thing in my mouth. My entree was the char grilled beef, which I actually picked after multiple reviews on here. It was so good. The beef was tender and flavorful, and the shoestring potatoes had a spicy sauce on them that all really blended together well. I didn't eat much of the greens, because they had raw red onion in them. I would've liked to have seen this mentioned on the menu, but it's my own fault for not asking.\n\nFor dessert I had the Buddha's Temple. It was fine. It was probably the low point of the meal for me. If you're a big chocolate fan, you'll probably like it more than I did, but it felt like something you can get anywhere. I also had two drinks: the Mindfulness cocktail and the passion fruit lemonade mocktail. I preferred the lemonade, but it might be too sweet for some.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful, though I will caution that it's quite loud. I was there at 5:45 on a Sunday and the music was pumping, which of course, causes everyone to speak loudly. The Buddha in the center is a fun focal point. I also had a fun conversation with one of the managers who told me that all the dumplings are made by hand daily by a woman they call Mama Han(?) who has been with them for 24 years. She estimated that she makes 1,000 dumplings every day.

The bread service was fresh focaccia and was amazing, definitely got us excited about everything else coming our way. I was most excited about the Francobolli Ravioli, which was a little disappointing; they weren't nearly as filled as I was expecting, and could have used a good bit more goat cheese to balance out the sweetness of the corn. The Salumi Misti was fantastic, along with the Flank Steak. The baked ricotta was nice and lemony, though one in my party thought a bit too much that it almost tasted artificial.

We came to Osteria to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary and we're disappointed by the horrible service. I made our reservation 1.5 weeks ago. I confirmed it on the phone and reminded the individual I spoke with of our anniversary. Upon entering the restaurant there was no greeting, no happy anniversary, which I didn't think anything of until we we're led to our table outside. This table seemed like in afterthought. It was outside right by the entrance gate, not in the greenhouse or in the true outdoor dining area. It was loud and smelled like diesel exhaust from all the cars going by. The view was of Broad Street.\nI asked Grace, the host who led us to our table, to take our photo because it was out anniversary. She begrudgingly agreed, took a few awful photos that she put no effort into, and didn't even have the politeness to say happy anniversary or enjoy your meal. We then requested to sit in the green room, with all the other happy, comfortably seated diners but instead, were led inside. We ordered four pastas, the baked ricotta, a cocktail, and a glass of prosecco. The prosecco and cocktail took 20+ minutes to arrive. I didn't drank one sip and it was room temperature. I did not take another. I voiced my concerns to TJ that this was our anniversary and I was expecting a different experience and he was unapologetic. In fact, rather than use this as an opportunity to improve our experience, he did the opposite. TJ did not check on us once during our meal. He did not bring clean plates or silverware. Another server took pity on us and brought us clean plates for our pastas. The pastas were not timed properly. They all arrived within 5 minutes. While the fazzoletti and the ravioli were delicious, good food is only fully enjoyed by good ambiance and service. Grace and TJ need further instruction and training on customer service.\n1) Grace was unfriendly, unwelcoming, and sat us at a horrible table that was very noisy due to sitting in front of traffic. Not the romantic setting for our anniversary we had hoped for.\n2) We asked to be seated in the green room, where there were empty tables, and were denied\n3) Our server, TJ, did not check on us ONCE during our entire meal. He picked up a plate and when we called to him he did hear or pretended not to hear. We had to ask multiple times for clean plates for dinner after our antipasti.\n4) When I communicated that we were disappointed with the seating and the experience to TJ, he did nothing to improve it... nor did he apologize.\n5) It took 20+ minutes to receive our drinks - my prosecco was room temperature.\n6) We were there for a special occasion, not once was it acknowledged. There was a mind-blowing lack of customer service.\n7) The four pastas were timed so that they all arrived within a few minutes- they didn't even fit on the table.\n\nThe food was good, but the service was despicable.

I was looking forward to a fine dining steak house.  The vibe was nice, beautiful restaurant with a great view of the downtown Nashville skyline from the bar.  We ordered a drink before getting seated, titos/soda water.  When the bill came it was $11.  Totally reasonable for a cocktail.   After we gave our card, the bill came back to add tip & signature & it was $13.67.  I was shocked that $2.67 added on for taxes, not tip.  My husband verified with the manager that the 25% tax rate was in fact correct.  She said yes it was.  I was surprised that it was so high but no problem,  paid it.  \n\nOur server was very friendly.  We ordered a nice dinner, 2 appetizers (wedge salad & cotton candy bacon).  Both were really good.  We ordered 3 entrees (one 10oz filet cooked medium-plus, one 6 Oz wagyu filet cooked medium rare & one scallops) along with 4 side dishes (creme brulee corn, potato agnolti, roasted broccoli & Mac n cheese).  When the entrees & sides arrived the sides were HOT as expected, the entrees were not even warm.  The medium plus steak was cooked medium rare, the scallops were gritty, cool & tasted rather fishy according to my husband. The creme brulee corn was exactly how I imagined it, too sweet for my liking but the others in my party liked it ok.  The potato agnolti was AMAZING, mac n cheese & broccolini were good as well.  The steak toppings were additional costs so we ordered a trio for $10 (chimichurri, truffle butter & truffle bernaiase).  The steaks were so NOT hot that the truffle butter never melted on the steaks.  The chimichurri sauce was delicious. \n\nThe manager that came & spoke to my husband in the bar explained about the taxes & was super friendly.  Even said sorry about the confusion, I will send an appetizer to your table on me.  In a fine dining establishment,  I wouldn't think that I would have to \"remind\" management of their comment so waited to see if the bill reflected her offer, it didn't.   But I'm not one to complain or bicker about $20 but it was just the principal.

The kitchen perfectly timed all the food to come at the same time, and brought us their complimentary popovers as well. \n\nI really cannot emphasize enough how perfect the food was here.

Their popovers are also incredible. \n\nWe even shared a steak & it was still quite expensive, but on the other hand we could only finish about half of each side & took the rest home.

The Caesar salad is also great with a yummy Worcestershire sauce made in house. I usually have the 6oz prime filet and it literally melts in your mouth. Best steak ever!

Front st cafe has the honor to be my first review. Unfortunately it is negative. No issues with food, I've experienced about half the menu from my dine-ins and everything was great. My issue comes from staffing. Bar staff is great and waiters are wonderful, it's the host staff and manager that have awful demeanors. We had a group of six come in and order takeout and the hostess (Allie/Ally) attending was giving remarks and side eyes as we sat at a table to wait. She had then sat a table where we were and told us to wait outside. (Keep in mind this is November and the temperature is 50-60 f with wind chill). We got our food and contacted the manager for an explanation as to why the hostess was so callous. The manager (Tim) notified us that we could have waited in the room upstairs for our food which was not told to us by any staff.

If it was busy I'm sure they would do they could seat more guests.\n\nMenu has lots of great healthy options and plenty that aren't. Breakfast served until 3 pm too! I had the berry salad with chicken and shared chicken strips with my friends. Another friend had a burger that she devoured. The other person had a salad, Caesar with a poached egg. She finished her plate.\n\nThe chicken strips were definitely shareable. Probably 5 -6 giant strips. Came with 3 delicious dipping sauces. I loved the mustard. My salad was huge!! I couldn't finish it. The protein cooked well. One note that it was really covered in dressing.

One of the best things about this place is that its outdoor seating has the best ambiance but we went on a slightly rainy/overcast day so we stayed indoors which nonetheless did not diminish our experience!\n\nWe went last Thursday for late lunch and were treated exceptionally well by our server. He was very attentive but patient with us (even though it took us quite some time to make up our minds and place our other!).\n\nI went with the All-Natural Chicken Sandwich no pickles, add avocado, and a side of fries. Would've have gotten a perfect 10/10 if not for just two small things: the fries being too salty and the cook forgetting to remove the pickles. Still 8/10 is pretty solid! My sandwich was juicy, fulfilling, and surprisingly delicious given that it was not a the typical big deep fried super breaded chicken breast style. Adding the avocado did cost a bit much ($3.50 extra) but it was worth it, that touch of avocado was *chefs kiss*. The fries were made almost too perfection but they were a bit too generous with the salt.\n\nMy cousin got the Griddled Cheese with a side of Fries and she was very much satisfied with zero complaints. I did take a bite of her sandwich and I almost wish that I would have went with that option. It was a bit too cheesy for me but the jalapeno-tomato jam was to die for. The slight sweetness complimented the cheese so well so if you are looking for a not so basic grilled cheese I wholeheartedly recommend this! Her fries were also a bit on the salty side too but not even one was left on our plates.\n\nWe did not get any drinks besides water so I cannot make any comments/suggestions on any..(water was good but that's hard to mess up)\n\nOverall, FSC had exceptional service, superb ambiance, and conventional dishes with delicious original twists!

We were so looking forward to our final meal of a great 4-day stay at the Philadelphia.   And I have to admit we were disappointed. Our server was excellent--friendly and knowledgeable about the wine we ordered.   However, he had to find a lighter to allow us to read the menus.   We ordered simply but so simply that I can't remember what I ate--tasted OK but was not memorable.  Mostly our dinner was overshadowed by the fact that we had to wait far too long for my husband's venison which, when it came, was sadly overcooked.   This time, it was the food that disappointed.

The hostess was so nice and even though we were indecisive about staying she did encourage us to stay while recommending other spots as well. Because of her honesty and the diversity of the menu we decided to stay. And I am soooo happy to report that we are glad that we did.\n\nBarbuzzo is a small and intimate spot with several tables on the right hand side and a bar in front of the kitchen and pizza oven--yes a legit real oven! The restaurant was crowded, but we managed to find a four top table in the middle of the restaurant. One part was a bench that I sat at and the other two chairs that my mom and friend sat at. It was a very tight squeeze, but once we got seated it was not bad. \n\nI could not decide what I wanted! Everything on their menu sounded amazing especially their pizzas. I went with their bronzino because all of the ingredients sounded delicious--especially the pesto and fennel! And wow, this dish, wow, full of flavor, super light, and so yummy! I wanted to keep eating and eating and you will too! The dish is just enough for one without feeling too overwhelming. The filet is seasoned well and is grilled to perfection.\n\nMy mom's meatballs did not disappoint either as the mozarella was baked right in the ball and was amazing as well. The meatballs came in a lightly sweet and savory red sauce. This was the same sauce that was on my friends Margherita pizza that she added sausage to. Wow, again so delicious! Worth the wait as the pizzas take longer to cook and come out compared to other entrees. We all dug into the pizza when it did come out, and yes, so good!\n\nOur waitress was nice and gave us some great recommendations. She was attentive as she could be with the restaurant being very full and the space being very small.\n\nOnly negative was that it was very cold inside. You definitely needed to dress in layers or continue to wear your coat--my mom did! Hopefully they can put in some space heaters or something to help with this? The warmth from my drink helped a little bit, but we were definitely very cold most of the time.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit when you are in Philadelphia!", "date": "2021-12-20 20:19:57", "user": {"name": "Chandra", "review_count": 960, "yelping_since": "2012-09-04 05:20:37", "elite": "2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.2, "fans": 57}}, {"review_id": "A6BfeEvNwhyV6d6qsQpnzw", "user_id": "DhUEuSrGJfONLDixnP3YkQ", "business_id": "6ajnOk0GcY9xbb5Ocaw8Gw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I have wanted to eat here for years but never made it happen, then Covid.

I was feeling concerned I might be disappointed with brunch being our first experience. That was a silly concern. Our experience was perfection. Service and cocktails were on point. We started with the Papas Fritas and mixed olives. We also had French Farmers and a Negroni. We ordered the uovo pizza and the shakshuka. My shakshuka was a spicy surprise. It came with the greens on top so when you tucked in you unearthed all the hot, tangy sauce and egg. I loved it so much more than I thought I would. Their shakshuka is chickpeas, garlic greens, baked eggs, butternut squash, roasted fennel, tomato, spicy yogurt, feta, and grilled country bread to sop it up with. Delicious. The uovo smelled intoxicating and my SO raved about it. I don't eat pork so I couldn't take it out for a spin.

We are aware that it is supply chain and labor shortage era \"you get what you get\" right now but this place is just taking advantage and being arrogant about it. Server (Rebecca) told us it was 'family style, so order more than you usually would\" (I thought family style meant bigger portions to share, but here it means regular portions just brought out in no planned order?) We ordered a salad, an app and two entrees. She flatly told us we needed to order more food. So we added on a pizza. We both got cocktails and when my friend finished his (a Manhattan-type cocktail) she said \"do you want another?\" and he said yes, she said 'great, we don't have that one anymore but I'll bring you a ____\" and dashed away. (It was hard to get her attention the whole meal and she didn't listen to let alone answer questions.) She brought back a whiskey on the rocks drink that was nothing like what he had agreed to re-order. Whatever. We asked if we could look at the beer list again and she hovered over us for an order (suddenly has a free second) so we just picked two. If there was possible tab-growing she hovered, if we had any additional concerns she completely ignored us. We were still grazing on our entrees and apps  - Nothing special, just carbs and cheese stuff that can be made at home very easily.  Then the (burnt black) pizza came out. This was entirely too much food and I felt mislead by this awful server. we ordered more beers and now had two drinks in front of us and a pizza, and I was still eating one of my entrees when the server zipped by and took it away ignoring me saying \"I wasn't done!\" We are catching up, taking our time because it was only 7:30 pm on a weeknight, the place wasn't packed, but we wanted to enjoy ourselves and had plenty of food and drink to keep working on in front of us. She came over with dessert menus. We said probably not and she frowned. \"We need a minute\" I said, meaning, to enjoy our company and eat slow and finish our drinks and get off our damn backs.

It's strange to say, but everyone is so sweet and thoughtful. Not to mention they remembered me the second time. Each visit I ordered a carafe of hot sake, which is my favorite thing to get at Japanese restaurants.\n\nFirst I tried the Tonkotsu Ramen, which has pork belly, pork shoulder, egg, bamboo shoots, and red chili oil. Super simple, tasty, and filling. It was just what I needed after a late night flight. The Tataki Maki roll I had the next night was unique. I've never had chimichurri atop sushi before! It was accompanied by shrimp tempura, cucumber, crab mix, seared tuna, tomato, and basil.\n\nLove that OBON is both family-friendly and hip at the same time.

They have been open a long time (since 2007) and I have been told by several people to try it but I've just never gone. I am happy I did today.\n\nThe menu consists of salads, soups and sandwiches and is just the right size. There are enough options for every diet to choose from and then there are daily soups which are on a rotation. The options listed online for today (Thursday) did not match was being sold in person. My brother had the pozole which is one of his and my favorite dishes. He seemed to enjoy it. I wish I tried it because it looked pretty tasty. \n\nI decided to try the grilled cheese sandwich. It's a very basic sandwich and anyone can make one, or can they? I want a nice crunchy bite when I am eating a freshly grilled cheesy sando. My sandwich today gave me that satisfaction. The bread was toasted just right and the cheese was gooey. I don't know if they put both cheeses in my sandwich. I could only see and taste the sharp cheddar, visually I could not see the white cheddar. I make sandwiches like this often and can always see the white and yellow cheddar melding together when I pull it apart. I did not see this on my sandwich today. This did not effect my enjoyment in any way. I also added prosciutto for $2.50 upcharge. They put in a good amount of it so it was worth the added cost. The sandwich came with a side salad which had mixed greens and cranberry with a dressing I think is balsamic vinaigrette. That cut the fat of the cheese sandwich nicely. \n\nThe space is small and cozy. There are seats outside but it's fall and cold and I'm a baby so we sat inside. The staff was friendly. They were very busy but we didn't have to wait long and the tables were bussed almost as quickly as people were leaving.

The grilled cheese was well toasted with the right ooey gooey cheese you'd expect. The minestrone was packed with the best ingredients and was deliciously warm. My daughter had the clam chowder and half of a club, and she pretty much finished the whole thing without me having to nag her (that's a sign of how much she enjoyed it), she even ate her side salad. \n\nAnd the service, everyone is always so polite and helpful. Our plates accidentally were missing the standard cookie and when I mentioned it to one of the servers, he brought us a cookie (and a couple extra) right away. \n\nHighly recommend this place, have been coming by for years and they never disappoint.

I always drive by and wonder why it's always busy. Well now I know and I'm so glad I tried this spot. This place is amazing! \n\nI arrived right before the lunch rush at 11:30am and I'm so glad I did because the line was out the door to the sidewalk. If you can avoid the lunch rush, I would highly recommend it. \n\nTheir menu consists of salads, sandwiches, and soups. This is a great spot for those with dietary restrictions, there is something for Vegans, Vegetarians, and Gluten free folks. The menu highlights which menu items are good for those with dietary restrictions. This was very helpful for me since I don't eat gluten. They also have great combo options so you can get a sandwich, salad, and/or soup in one meal. \n\nThe spot: \nThis is a cute restaurant located in Midtown. It has some indoor seating and a great outdoor patio with plenty of seating. They also have outdoor heaters too. If you call in an order for pickup, they have a curbside pickup parking lot available in the back of the restaurant. It's only accessible from Saint Lawrence Ave. \n\nThe food: \nOMG, I'm obsessed with the Strawberry Salad! Mixed greens, topped with balsamic strawberries, gorgonzola cheese, sliced almonds, and white balsamic vinaigrette. I never knew I loved white balsamic vinaigrette until I tried this one. It pairs with this salad so nicely. I love pepperoncinis on my salad so I added it to give the salad some extra crunch and tangy flavor. I also added their grilled chicken, because why not. It was perfect! This salad with strawberries is only seasonal, so when they don't have strawberries they switch to dried cranberries. This salad is so good, I've only ordered the large size. Trust me, it's that good and worth it. \n\nI tried a cup of Loaded Baked Potato soup! Topped with cheddar cheese and crunchy bacon. It was to die for! I love that they have so many different flavors of soup available every day. They also have a rotating soup menu that is only available certain days of the week, all of their soups are listed on their website. Be sure to try some of their amazing soups. \n\nMy mom tried The Club sandwich. She loved the rosemary chicken breast and the garlic mustard aioli. The cheddar bread was fresh and soft. A really great Club sandwich! She made it a combo and got the cranberry salad and a cup of chicken tortilla soup. Everything was amazing! \n\nEach meal comes with a house baked cookie. They're oatmeal chocolate chip and are NOT gluten free. I hear they're pretty tasty! \n\nThe drinks:\nThey have a fridge loaded with sodas, juices, water, and beer. They also have a soda machine and a water station available too. \n\nI'm already thinking about my next visit! Looking forward to trying more menu items. Definitely try this spot if you haven't already.

I understand things happen but this was off the charts.  To begin with yesterday evening we (table of 2) ordered fries with kg sauce and waited an hour for them.

Meanwhile multiple tables who sat after us and had bigger parties were finishing up their meals and paying while getting constant service.  I felt like I was being treated as a 2nd class citizen.  Even other servers were asking us why the food never came.  We got a second server who apologized and said something weird is going on tonight.  Food still came out cold after waiting so long.  Steak came out raw, my fianc\u00e9 couldn't eat it and they brought the wrong side when we never even changed the side it comes with originally.  Wrong food, cold food, 1.5 hour wait for said food.

My salmon was absolutely delicious and I loved all the flavors that went into it. The vanilla bean was also pretty good. My bf ordered the crispy coconut shrimp, parmesan crusted flounder and peanut butter pie. His shrimp was awful. I'm sorry but it was over cooked and shriveled up. Did not taste like shrimp, no hints of coconut and we both agreed that if we were blind folded we would not have been able to guess what we were eating. It sadly just tasted burned. His flounder and peanut butter pie were both outstanding 10/10. Out of everything we ordered, I'd recommend the flounder, salmon, and peanut butter pie! \n\nService was also just okay. Our waiter was very friendly, but we had to wait a very long time for water, to order drinks, and to order food. This sounds like a minor complaint, but they forgot to give us our basket of bread. Tables all around us were getting bread and refills of it, but not us so we had to ask for some. Very minor, but a bit off and annoying that we had to ask for it. \n\nBeautiful establishment in a great location. Our experience was not the best last night, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't come back again. Maybe it was just a one time experience.

After all, what were we going to do? Get up and walk out? Several tables around us were served before us even though we were seated 15 minutes before them.  When the food arrived we got mashed potatoes and gravy, sweet potato (I was confused, 2 potatoes.) Two slices of turkey, and stuffing. Turkey and stuffing were cold.  Stuffing was from a box, as were the potatoes.  Too much bouillon in the stuffing (extremely salty). Anything we needed we had to ask for. Several times. For such a plain dinner why the struggle? For $39.50 per person?? We are not giving up on lucky dill... but we won't make the Thanksgiving mistake again. (PS: we observed the servers at the other tables,  and concluded that many of my grievances would not be voiced if they had served us.)", "date": "2021-11-26 22:32:52", "user": {"name": "everett", "review_count": 32, "yelping_since": "2011-01-07 14:03:22", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.17, "fans": 0}}, {"review_id": "olfkRSFBgzeUQZ_SVTsUZQ", "user_id": "oYmA5dohnI0AYfF_8-dVNA", "business_id": "ZfOS7Mz-iGseNxBhlhXm_w", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Normally we really enjoy this local joint for lunch but today we decided to drop in for breakfast and pick it up to-go in the bakery.

It was incredibly meaty. I am not going to lie, it was a struggle to finish it, but I did.

Our waitress was very rude and seemed very preoccupied with other tables. Giving the benefit of the doubt as my group had 6 people and there were other groups there larger than mine that she had to assist. Her rudeness was also noted by someone that joined our table. We ordered an appetizer that didn't come out until our food was prepared. By then it wasn't much of an appetizer. Someone at our table(not with our party) found a long hair in her soup. The gentleman cooking our food miscalculated portion sizes and everyone received varying amounts of rice and veggies. Those that had the same thing missed out on portions(for me it was scallops) my mother ordered the steak and shrimp and he had given all of the shrimp away and had to request more be sent out in order to make hers. Finally when it came time to pay, the waitress through my card on the table and said \"Decline\". I explained that was impossible and asked to run the card again. She told me \"No I ran it 4 times\". I asked if she could again and this time she ran the card while I looked on. The credit card reader said \"Chip Malfunction\" yet she insisted my card declined. Someone who I assume was a leader came over to help. She too saw the message and said the same thing about my card declining. I replied that it says chip malfunction and not decline and that I've not had issues with my card all day. To which she replied \"we run lots of cards everyday\". I think she sensed my frustration and went to another terminal to try my card. And like magic, it worked. I have never been more embarrassed at a business.

Up until I was approximately 20 or maybe 21, I had never tasted sushi. My best friend took me here and it was a far beyond superb first experience. Initially, my first thoughts on what sounded ideal to me was something along the lines of hibachi shrimp and steak with fried rice. But, with a little poking and prodding and encouragement from my buddy, I decided to give in and broaden my horizons by trying some authentic Japanese sushi. Right off the bat, the waitresses, hostesses, and hibachi chefs are very engaging and enthusiastic. Nothing in particular struck me to where I would declare or label this place filthy or unkept. Cleanliness seems to be something they could put on a resume as a qualification. From placing a drink or meal order up until you receive your food, the timing is pretty decent and along the lines of ideal. Long enough so you can catch up and talk with your date, friend, or family members, but quick enough to where you don't get anxious because your stomach is growling from hunger. Oh yeah, miso soup and a small salad are included with your meal. \n\nWhat I got that first time is pretty typical to what I get every time I go there now: 1 shrimp sushi roll, 1 scallop sushi roll, 1 spicy chicken roll, and a miso soup. I love seafood so I didn't think or assume that I would not take too kindly to this new delicacy. I loved every single bite I had that night. What I really appreciate and what stands out to me about the spicy chicken roll, is that it would make a very good introductory sushi roll to possibly a preteen or young adult who wants to get into sushi. Then, I'd say branch out and give the shrimp or crab roll a chance afterwards.\n\nI have always loved this place and I can't see myself not continuing to go in the near future!", "date": "2020-07-06 01:28:02", "user": {"name": "Mark", "review_count": 36, "yelping_since": "2014-02-20 14:24:55", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.93, "fans": 0}}, {"review_id": "6ujf9mjmOXNDSX7wWGUcQw", "user_id": "NTF0aCoUZdRATneTnPbdXA", "business_id": "MJ9FaB4y2jCyn1CU7Fnj2Q", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "This place seems kinda weird from the outside, but it's so so yummy!

Potatoes were flavorful and crisp, spinach was good as well. \n\nI had goat cheese and herb ravioli. Waitress told me the pasta is made in house and I don't doubt her. The pasta and sauce was really good and fresh. The filling kinda tasted like the herb infused ch\u00e8vre you can purchase at the supermarket. It was still really good though. \n\nFor dessert wifey got the flamboirsue (sp?). I got the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. Can't go wrong with processed sugar, but it was nothing to write home about. \n\nService was good. A little on the spendy aside, especially $4 a shrimp. I find that a little unnecessary.

Then came back several minutes later and asked, \"Do you want something to drink, or just water?\" I don't know why he couldn't just ask us, \"What would you like to drink?\" like they do in almost every other nice restaurant. My wife ordered for us (Porterhouse for two) while I was away in the restroom, he verbally confirmed our order with her, then when I returned, he asked me if that was what I wanted. Why he didn't believe my wife is beyond me. The bread, to my taste, was stale and dry.

The mashed potatoes were also bland.\n\nI appreciate steak served on hot plates-- and I heard other waiters tell their tables that the plates were hot when placed on the table. Our waiter did not tell us this. Good thing neither of us touched the plates--when I put a piece of cooked steak on my plate it sizzled. That's how hot the plate was--and we weren't told. I don't completely understand why the plates were served greasy, I've seen other restaurants serve hot plates that were clean, but honestly, it wasn't the worst of the night.\n\nThe wine and steak were quite good. The other waiters helping our waiter were very nice. Our waiter got super friendly at the end of the meal, and I have to think he was looking for a nice tip. I felt the bare minimum on a couple hundred dollar bill I could leave was 15%--mostly because the other waiters deserved something if the tip is split, so that's what I did. Mediocre bread, potatoes and drink I could have almost handled--it was all because of our waiter's service that I tipped this low.\n\nI shared a good portion of this feedback with the restaurant via the service I booked the reservation through, by the way, and gave them the waiter's name, and the day I was there, which I'm witholding here.

My wife and I decided to enjoy a premium steak before attending a comedy show in Ybor City recently.  We both have been to multiple steakhouses in the Tampa area and chose Ruth's Chris for this experience.  If you call and they are completely booked up from a reservation perspective, they do offer open seating in the bar area.  They can accommodate seats at bar, high tables away from the bar, and booths, as well.  We wanted the calamari as an appetizer, but, unfortunately, they didn't have it this night.  We decided on the sizzling crab cakes.  Not only were they delicious, but they were literally sizzling when the waiter brought them to our table.  My wife ordered off of the Ruth's classics menu which is a three course meal featuring the Chef's favorite recipes.  It comes with a starter, entr\u00e9e and a side, and dessert.  Also, note that, if the entree or side you desire is not on the classics menu, you are allowed to substitute at an additional cost.  My wife ordered the 16oz ribeye with a lobster tail and a side of sweet potato casserole whereas I ordered the same steak with a loaded baked potato.  The food was absolutely fantastic.  The steak melted in my mouth like butter and it should be illegal how good the sweet potato casserole tastes.  I am convinced it is actually a dessert masquerading as a side.  It is dangerously good.  The service was fantastic, also.  If you visit, be sure to ask for Savannah and Jacob.  They did an awesome job.  There are many steakhouses to choose from in the bay area, but, if you are seeking a fine-dining experience, Ruth's Chris Steak House offers a high-quality meal with exceptional customer service.

With all that said, our experience here at the Nashville MP with my husband for our 2yr Anniversary celebration was hands down the BEST Melting Pot dinner to date! While our food was very tasty and fresh and near perfect as always, our server, Heather, made the entire meal!!! Y'all give her a raise!!!!\n\nWe decided on the Full 4 Course Experience for 2 with Wisconsin cheddar cheese, MP house salads, the Classic entree (shrimp, herb crusted chicken, teriyaki steak, and sirloin) with Mojo broth, and flaming turtle chocolate! Our tummies are SO happy :) All the food was fresh and flavorful, and perfectly spaced so we could enjoy each course. Their signature dipping sauces always complement the meat, seafood, and vegetables perfectly. I think my 2 favorites are green goddess and the Gorgonzola.\n\nOh, and the Watermelon Cooler? It is THE PERFECT non-alcoholic summer drink. Refreshing, light, and just the right amount of cucumber and watermelon flavor.\n\nIf you have been on the fence about trying out the Melting Pot, or haven't been to the Nashville location, I highly recommend you make your reservation today! \n\nThank you again, Heather!

Once you get into the second door, the mood is pretty romantic and the staff that greets you is pleasant and makes it easy to check in. It was our first time there and we already had high expectations when we were being sat to our table. We had to wait a little bit to get our waiter over but when he came over, and asked if it was our first time, he gave us a brief explanation on how it works. The price is pretty high but after asking question on how it all works, you do get a four course meal. After figuring it all out and ordering, our waiter, left us to go prepare our first dish. We had to wait a while to get our first dish, the cheese, but we expected a little wait to get it all prepared. The first dish we chose was the loaded potato cheese, ingredients pretty simple, the waiter, who was a bit more talkative then he should have been prepared it for us. This is where the two star rating starts. A few moments later our salads where brought out  and we ordered cocktails to go with our entr\u00e9. My water and my companions were getting close to empty and we waited a solid 25 min just for someone to bring us the starting cooking saut\u00e9 to boil our food in. Given, though they are usually very busy, this was a day they were close to being dead, maybe 4 or 5 other tables and 1 large table at the end. When we finally got our saut\u00e9 the man acted like he was in a rush and quickly hit the mechanism that ended up splattering some of the saut\u00e9 all over the table and then turned the heat on high and left. We then waited another 25 minutes for our entree to come out, just for it to come out wrong, then to correct it, it took another 15 minutes. After we finally got our meat to boil we only got one meat done before our cooker turned off and wouldn't turn back on. Our waiter was no where to be seen to grab his attention so we had to mess with the heating and power button ourselves to get it to turn back on. It was another 15-20 minutes messing with it before we got it to turn back on to cook the rest of our food. By this time, our waters were empty, we finally saw the waiter for him to give us our cocktails we asked for to go with our entree, and a refill on water. My companion at this point was so stressed out he didn't really enjoy any of the food. With your entree you get \"on the house veggies\" to go with your entree but when we first used our \"on the house veggies\" and tried to get more the waiter was no where to be seen. I finally caught him at a different table and had to lift our white empty veggie bowl up just to get his attention. Our desert was amazing, the chocolate, but honestly it was the only thing we actually enjoyed. When we finally got done and received our ticket, our waiter came and swiped our card and watched and stared at us to see how much we would tip him. He put the tipping rate at 30% which he did not deserve, he honestly didn't deserve the 20% we gave him. The manager had come to our table and asked if our food was good and I do admit at the time he came over and asked us, we were already pretty fed up and just didn't want to deal with getting the already allusive waiter  to treat us any more poorly. I am sad to say I don't think we will be making any further trips to the melting pot.

He was polite and quick given he had A LOT of tables to take care of. He explained everything for us to make sure we got the best dining experience. We did the Alpine cheese dip (my favorite), 2 Caesar salads, 1 classic entree, and the s'mores dessert fondue. The bill came out to be 51$ !!! Talk about saving money, usually for two people it's 100$++ ... but I have been here before and know how much food it could be and I got smart when ordering. We decided to share an entree because the cheese fondue plus the salad is already filling before the dinner comes out. And we had plenty room for the dessert. \n\nI believe our waiters name was Silver? He was absolutely great!

So I tried the:\n\n-Dragon Maki Roll= tempura shrimp, avacado, unagi (little small but decent)\n-Dragon Ball Roll= tempura shrimp, unagi, avocado, spicy crab, tabiko (lots of toppings!)\n-Seared Salmon Nigiri (amazing seared flavor)\n-Tobiko Unagi Nigiri (delicious!)\n-miso soup (could be more flavorful)\n-fried gyoza (too fried, but seems homemade w/ chunks of filling, not mushy like prefrozen)\n-quail egg shooter (sauce too sweet)\n-green tea ice cream (think this is the best green tea ice cream I've had)\n-pineapple ice cream (wish I could take a tub of this home)\n\nGeeze Eric, how much did that cost?? Only $27.95! Because it's all you can eat! Made to order, not buffet style.  Sushi chef Carlos was fast and helpful, his service was fantastic! \n\nHighlights? The salmon Nigiri and the Dragon Ball Roll are scrumptious. Everything had a generous amount of ingredients (Dragon Maki Roll could use a little more unagi). \n\nWhy does this place have so many mixed reviews? Seems like the majority of good reviews are sit-in and the majority of bad reviews are delivery or take out. This restaurant does seem busy with take out and delivery apps.  If you don't eat your sushi here quick enough, the rice does get kinda \"chewier\" which I can see why some negative reviews said the rice is bland with no rice vinegar. \n\nMoral of the story: for the best experience, dine in at Kitzmo! 5 stars for the quality for the price", "date": "2021-12-17 04:11:26", "user": {"name": "Eric", "review_count": 222, "yelping_since": "2012-08-31 04:49:37", "elite": "2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.5, "fans": 19}}, {"review_id": "xg8aeSx4nGYIoctgaQ4U1w", "user_id": "FOsxw3-j14UKDahQBzBsJA", "business_id": "lVAjWGOqyZOFHMEw5NLt9g", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "The worst sushi that we have ever tried...

The other ingredients otherwise had a wonderful fresh flavor!! Very nice!\nWe asked for some Ponzu sauce.  (Need some flavor here)\nAnd after a long wait and again asking....\"It\" was served.

The flavors are there though, so if the chef can adjust the thickness, there is potential to be a great dish.\n\nSimilarly, the scallop dumpling has great potential as well, but the skin is for some reason VERY THICC once again which hurts the dish overall. \n\nFor me, the Lotus Wrap Sticky Rice with Chicken had promising flavors, and when I added some much needed salt myself, it was a reasonable dish.\n\nThe Xiao Long Bao had no soup inside, which was disappointing, but it did have good flavor.\n\nThe Chicken Feet is very well flavored and cooked. There were no small and dangerous teeth shattering bones, which is a great plus. \n\nTheir Siu Mai is a standard Siu Mai in terms of taste and texture. Nothing out of the ordinary, which was good!\n\nI liked their Salted Egg Lava Bun, it had all the correct flavors and consistency, and there was actually lava!\n\nThe Bean Curd Roll was one of their strongest dishes. It had really good flavor and texture.

The following is an unpublished review I wrote before the pandemic. \n\nAn average Chinese restaurant that offers Americanized dishes. \"Authentic?\" No. My family are typical Americans, who used to come here to enjoy \"Chinese cuisine.\" But after living in Asia especially in Hong Kong and China for months, we couldn't eat the foods from this restaurant anymore. We ordered take out (Moo Goo Gai Pan, Ribeye with Szechuan Pickled Sour Mustard Green, and Ants on the Tree\") after we came back. The tastes were so different from those we had in Asia, but not in a good way. We thought the experience might have been been different if we had dined in.

My expectations were low from all our previous experiences; however, my back up plan is always the prime rib which always has been a safe delicious bet. I am extremely excited to report that this place has changed exponentially!!! And definitely for the better! Literally, there's been a complete turn around and has come up 100%. The Dungeness crab was cooked perfectly... no more over-soaked water logged crab here! The shells were strong and easy to crack and the meat firm and easy to pick out. Super delicious with the hot drawn butter and cocktail sauce. My husband enjoyed the oysters on the half shell but was disappointed that there wasn't any mignonette sauce that had been advertised. He still enjoyed them though! We also enjoyed the salt and pepper shrimp and prime rib was delicious as always. They had clam chowder and even had sourdough bread bowls... it was decent... could have been seasoned better as it was pretty bland but I threw some salt, pepper and Tabasco in it and had a few bites. Even the desserts have been upgraded... they looked beautiful and most tasted very good. My husband loved the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake and we both always get a scoop of ice cream on a cone when we leave. We took a moment to call over the general manager and let him know how much we enjoyed our meal and how it was clearly obvious that big changes had occurred definitely for the better. I took 1 star for not having the advertised mignonette sauce, the bland soup and having to wait for condiments that weren't stocked on the table such as the Tabasco as well as having to wait for mimosas when you're on a time limit. Overall... Great job everyone! You definitely got it right this time!

Then I tried the Benedict it wasn't even edible and I love me a good Benedict- I spit it out, and I see my partner start to peel her cocktail shrimp- and I'm like is that the shrimp that smells back, and I look and we notice it's all slimy- no Mami's are you eating that, so here we are going for another plate, I get their sausage (spoiled) I spit that out the moment I tasted it- So we head to the Pho bar and next thing I know people are bring up shrimp, clams and crab- Well Sh*+ i guess I can't eat there either- because now it's cross contaminated tho it's only suppose to be a chicken and beef both with pork wontons... at this kpoint we decided to just leave and cut our loss.

Their Mexican pizza is enormous and so much better than the fast food chain! The Mexican steak dish is marinated skirt steak sauteed with onions, Jalapeno's and served with rice, beans, guac and tortillas and it is a hit! My absolute favorite thing on the menu are the Mexican rolls. Giant eggroll wrappers stuffed with meat and cheese served with a warm ranchero sauce to dip them in.

Then when I asked for some sort of restitution for the inconvenience he acted like he never heard the word restitution before. I honestly believe with his vocabulary, lack of being a manager and training this word went way over his brain capacity! Sadly we will NEVER eat or recommend this place to anyone again!

My family was put in a room on the 46th floor. With that said you would think we were on the ground floor because the street noise was so loud. My husband said it sounds like the cars were in the room lol. I'd suggest sleeping with ear plugs or bringing a white noise machine with you if you have trouble blocking out intrusive sounds.  That's the only one of two downsides to our stay. \n\nNOW to the positives because there are plenty!\n\nCheck-in was a breeze and the customer service from everyone at the front desk was amazing. Normally I walk away with a bit of worry but every question I may have had was answered fully. \n\nThe package I purchased included a breakfast buffet in the club lounge however due to covid breakfast is now at the restaurant on the second floor and it just gets charged to the room then zeroed out at check-out supposedly we shall see at the end of my stay when I get the folio. I'm doing this review in real time so by the end you'll get all the nitty gritty. \n\nThe rooms are decently spacious. CLEAN.However I feel jipped with these double beds felt like I was back in college fighting over mattress space with my husband lol. Sheraton could really benefit from having Queen beds. The beds were perfect for my two toddlers to share though. The price I'm paying for this room doesn't correlate with the bed is all I'm saying. There were plenty plugs in the room for all our charging needs! There are 4 plugs 2 on each side of the night stand. Invest in a dual charging block or bring a surge protector if you need to plug in a lot of stuff close to the bed. \n\nValet was simple Jazmine went over everything I needed to know to get my car back and was very pleasant and warm. You text a number to get your car and they'll text you back when it's downstairs ready for you takes about 15 minutes. However valet was crazy at night the line to get to the front door stretched down the street.\n\nNow these are some fancy elevators and they're fast. So instead of pressing a number inside the elevator you type in what floor you need to go to outside and then it tells you which letter elevator to go to. No more having to worry about your kid playfully pressing buttons. \n\nThere's a Starbucks in the lobby but perks of club level I can get some for free in the club room but if you want specialty coffees and fraps the lobby is where you'll be headed. \n\nThere's also a doggy area right outside the property it's gated and big enough for your fur babies to roam and do their business. \n\nMasks are required in public areas and vaccination cards or a negative PCR tests for dining areas and restaurants as we were asked to show them when we went to Coteries for dinner.\n\nBreakfast was buffet style but you hand them your plate. These grits were phenomenal! I didn't have to add anything to them. Everything taste great and fresh. People please stop fussing.\n\nWhew checkout was a rollercoaster but with Tequila or however you spell her name. she kept moving her name tag to where it wasn't fully visible but to be an Envoy Elite member and treated in a dismissive manner put a damper on what was a great trip. I'm not sure if the overwhelming amount of people who were there for other events got to her but she could've told me she needed a moment and I would have totally understood. I had questions about my bill but another clerk came over with an issue from a guest they were helping and they totally forgot about me. Thankfully Sarah came and asked if I needed help since I was still standing there lol but she addressed my concerns with the bill because it was$230 more than I was to be charged initially. \n\nAll in all I would definitely come back but would book a king bed suite for more space for my family.

The rooms look like the 80s, dark carpet, old worn furniture, and a tiny dark bathroom. Not even enough plugs - you have to hunt for them.

There was one time, where it appeared that it took 5 workers, to deal with one guests lost car keys issue.  Why did I have to be impacted by that if there were enough workers to get my car, while one person could have dealt with his lost car keys issue.  \n\nI also have to say that they need to highly invest in new remote controls for their televisions.

It should not take almost 30 minutes to log into Netflix because the television is slow to react to the remote.  \n\nOn another note, I inquired about a refrigerator before I traveled.  I was told that my concerns would be forwarded.

Fine.  But when we got there there were small bags of potato chips, two types of granola bars and that was it, no matter what time of day you arrived. All four days we were there the Espresso Beans were never refilled. I get that it's \"Covid Tome\" but have some imagination. At 5 pm, put out individually wrapped crackers, cheeses and veggies.\nSmall bottles of wine or something that makes me feel like a valued Bonvoy Member. \n\nAnd why is it that everywhere I went on the lobby, it smelled like Dank Weed?!?\n\nThe restaurant was a disaster. We had \"coupons\" for breakfast. The first day they handed us a menu with limited options, I get it. \nThe second day we were shown to our table and TOLD there's the buffet, enjoy. \nI didn't want the buffet. There were no other options given. \nSo I went to the buffet, which is more money than the \"meal tickets\" allowed for which is unexpected.\nHere's what I found on the buffet: \nThere were flies in the bread rack, the pancakes were, literally, cold and hard. The eggs were inedible and the sausage links were fry, overcooked and tasteless. The fruit cup was old, and was clearly from a previous meal.  And on the second day they made us get our own coffee and carry it to our table without providing saucers. \nThere were no saucers to catch the coffee that splashed as I walked.  And other than someone Seating us and handing us a bill, no one ever came to our table.  I finally lost my appetite completely when I realized just how dusty and dirty the banquet seating and chair rail were. I'm pretty sure it hasn't been dusted since Louisiana was purchased.\nAnd why, for the love of goodness are people in the portico selling weed?  I can tell you.

I told him we made a reservation and he said noble pie was no longer doing reservations. We didn't know what to do or what that meant because the website states reservations are required at both locations until mid March.\n\nThen he said we could hang out and proceeded to do other stuff while we were still standing there.

Even to the point of being dismissive of my opinion since I had not.\n\n  I really wanted to knock this one out in 2020 but being an \"essential worker\" has made it hard to do anything this season, but I digress.\n\n  I went here on a Saturday night a couple weeks back and it was lightly seated, with delivery drivers seeming to make most of their business. They have a good selection of hard spirits and beer behind the bar. Limited seating in an already somewhat cozy space.\n\n  I ended up taking to the kitchen manager before I ordered to find out how the wings were cooked.  Mainly because I prefer a fried chicken wing to a baked one.  Its a texture thing.\n\n  They actually par bake the chicken beforehand and finish it in the fryer.  I imagine this is because the wings themselves are very meaty. Like twice the size of a normal buffalo wing.  If you tried to deep fry something big and meaty, you tend to overcook the outside and leave the inside a little rare.\n\n  The result is chicken that has a more roasted texture, rather than crispy fried. Think a rotisserie chicken.  Juicy and flavorful. No, It doesn't have very crispy skin but it's still very good.  It is also served fast, probably less than 7 min.  \n\n  Then there is the toppings, which consisted of peppers, garlic and parm.  Perfectly accented th chicken without overpowering it or making me want to scrape off the detritus before I dipped it in the house made ranch. Which, by the way, is the best ranch I've had.\n\n  So yes, Noble Pie knocks it out of the park with their wings.  Not something I will seek out when I am wanting traditional style but definitely something I will suggest to anyone wanting a nice, juicy and meaty wing.

We had reservations at 11 and were seated immediately in a cozy booth.\n\nWe started off with Manmosas which are pint-size mimosas (really reasonable at $8). They were very tasty. Unfortunately they were out of one of the beers that someone in my party wanted to try. We all ordered different things: French Toast Special, Daddy's Favorite, Corned Beef Hash, and the Big Freakin' Biscuit. Overall we all really enjoyed our meals. My biscuit was really good, but my side of grits was disappointing, it was pretty watery and not creamy. My boyfriend commented that the Daddy's Favorite was good, but not the best he's had. \n\nI will comment on the portion sizes, because I thought they were a little off. All were a little smaller- but still filling. However, the French Toast portion was massive while the Corned Beef Hash was smaller than the rest of our meals. \n\nOverall, I'd definitely come back from brunch.

We sat at a large table towards the back.\n\nThe first thing you need to do when brunching at The Refinery (for the rest of its life... which I hear won't be much longer) is order two or three orders of the Sweet Biscuit Debris before they run out. This heavenly dish is made up of fried biscuit bits in powdered sugar, served with homemade jam. They are limited supply, so that's why I urge you to do this immediately. Everyone at the table agreed that they're like a reinvented beignet that we didn't know we needed. But we did. And you do. So do it.\n\nI also ordered the Green Curry Banana Pancakes ($12) served with a lemongrass anglaise and ancho maple syrup. These were a nice muted sweet flavor with a subtle aromatic curry flavor that added interest. Everyone at the table wanted a bite and everyone agreed that they were a great take on a typical brunch dish.\n\nMy friends ordered savory dishes, of which I tried a few, and all were worth ordering again.

Ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich to eat with the rest of my party in the restaurant. Everyone's food came out and I was still waiting on my sandwich. My sister shared her salad with me because I was the only one not eating. I asked the waitress if the sandwich should come out before the pizza since that was the point of me ordering it, she said yes the sandwiches usually come out quick and your pizza should be done in about 10 minutes. She asked if I wanted her to just cancel my sandwich and remove it from the bill. I said yes since I ate off other plates in my party and everyone was already eating done. My pizza did in fact come out before my sandwich. Was still charged for the sandwich and they put it in a to go box. Told the waitress we didn't want it to please take it off the bill since the point was to eat it in the restaurant with my party. She gave me a very snooty side smile and walked away with the bill and the box. The whole meal she took a very long time to bring refills. When we asked for a refill one of the times because she forgot I guess she responded \"yes, but give me a minute.\" And it was not a nice tone she used.

In order to escape the snow and ice in the northern part of the state, my wife, daughter, and I made a trip for a few days to New Orleans (pulling a Cruz?). We had been in town for a couple of days and decided to try the little barcade next to our hotel for lunch.\n\nIt was just before the start of the Celtics and Pelicans game, and out on the porch, Anthony Mackie was with a couple of friends, smoking a cigar. Now, yes, I know him best as Falcon, but I was closer to his role in 'Hurt Locker' as a former combat veteran, his acting resonated with me. And I wanted to meet him.\n\nMy wife didn't believe it was him first, but after talking to the waitress, it was confirmed. I asked if it would be okay to ask him for an autograph, she said he was usually pretty chill about that, brought me a pen and ticket and wished me luck. I waited a few minutes and then approached.\nHe stopped me short and said he was social distancing. No autographs. I was disappointed, but I took a moment to thank him for his work and that I really enjoyed him as an actor. I returned to my table and took a seat. My daughter wasn't feeling well, so we decided to order to go and head back to the hotel to eat.\n\nWhile we were waiting, Barcadia's manager came over to the table. I was worried at first that we were going to be asked to leave. Instead, he asked what we were drinking. My wife and daughter both had water -- I had a coke. He laughed and told us 'There's someone that wanted to buy our drinks!' I had a total and complete squee moment but was sad that well... no drinks. He said no worries, he'll figure out something.\n\nWe had the bourbon burger and Ceaser salad - the burger was cooked perfectly medium well. The sauce was a little heavy on the sweet, but it was off-set by the smokiness of it. The salad was fresh and crisp. We had the cheese curds as well. The were perfectly sized and the cajun seasoning was a nice touch. While the place may have been a little loud for us to think at times, the meal was wonderful. \n\nAs we were leaving, the waitress brought us our food to go and a T-shirt for our daughter, his compliments.

The edamame were flavored with garlic and Parmesan which gave it that extra kick, and the Brussels were full, juicy and delicious, the sauce was fire. Chicken wings were good too the meat fell off the bone easily and the spicy flavored ones were on point.\n\nFor mains I chose the beef bibimbap, short ribs galbi, bulgogi bowl and japchae noodles. Everyone agreed the bulgogi bowl was out of this world next level delicious. It was definitely the highlight dish and I am already craving more of it. The japchae noodles I also really enjoyed, I haven't seen a sweet potato noodle used too often and I really appreciated the delicate texture and slight sweetness of the dish- well done! I liked the short rib galbi however there was a little too much bone in the dish which made it less appealing and hard to get the meat out.

When we got there, they told us 15-20 minutes. It was a busy night before the holidays, so we grabbed a drink at the bar. After the time passed, the hostess looked at me like she'd never seen me before and said she'd check if they had any tables available. Isn't the point of a reservation to avoid that? We decided to just eat at the bar and the manager bought us a round for the issue. \n\nWe started with the kale salad which was great. Also ordered the Porta Porta \"pizza\" and a double portion of a pasta dish. When the \"pizza\" came out we were sure they had our order confused. What they called a pizza, and 3 of us were expecting to have a slice or 2 of, was actually a calzone cut into about 5 very tiny squares, with no cheese or filling in the end pieces. \n\nTime had passed and we asked if the pasta was coming. The bartender look confused and was frantically on the register and said it went to the wrong table. Clearly, he had never put it in but was able to get us a plate in about 5-10 minutes. My first bite I pulled out a short blonde hair (and there were no blondes with us). He brought it back and got us a new one and comped it, but the meal was already ruined. Side note: the double portion is served in a huge plate but the actual serving size is that of a child's portion. \n\nAnd, as we were finishing, us and the ladies next to us were told more than once that the stools that we were on we're going to be removed soooo basically get up. It turns into more of a club at night, but I've never heard of bar stools needing to be removed and definitely not in such a rude fashion.

Apparently there were a couple of defective glasses because his wine was just disappearing. Seriously, it was a great cab.\n\nWe chose the bone marrow and octopus apps and were a little let down. The bone marrow was topped with pickled veggies and served with pita bread. I blame myself. I'm sure it was spelled out on the menu, but I checked the online menu at home prior to, and was set on this dish. It was described there with grilled onions and a baguette. The marrow itself was delicious, I just pined for the onions and baguette. The pita just didn't measure up to the rich flavor of the marrow.  I feel like it was an odd pairing. The octopus was ok.\n\nFor mains I had the Hanger Steak and he had the duck. Meat flavors were awesome, portions were small. My husband's duck was very chewy. My steak was only accompanied by bland black rice. I was bummed. We ordered sides of roasted cauliflower and Brussels sprouts.  They were both delicious and I would have them again.\n\nNo chocolate desserts on the menu, so Bree was sweet enough to bring us a small bowl of some seriously tasty chocolate chips to snack on. I'm telling you, she was the best! \n\nI had been here years ago for lunch and was impressed. This visit was less than stellar, but I'm going to try again.

The entrees took a long time to arrive but the food was served hot in an attractive style. The duck was very tasty and the curried goat was delicious. The risotto served with the hanger steak was delicious and outshined the steak. The fish special was a tad dry and the chicken was average. I think they were short staffed due to Jazz Fest because the drink refills were slow as was the table clearing. Prior to our dessert course, the slow service was overshadowed by the pleasant staff. However the dessert course changed that. The staff was obviously overworked, due to the crowd, and the smiles faded and were replaced by snarky comments.

Easy reservation to get and we mostly had a great dinner.  Few hiccups but nothing egregious (I had no idea how to spell this word.  Thank you spell check).  \n\nEasy reservation to get for 7:30pm on Saturday.  Convenient but suspicious.  It's a quaint house converted to restaurant.  Only street parking, which was no problem.  I parked right in front.  I was the envy of nearby patio patrons...I assume.\n\nThe food was pretty darn good.  I had the duck which was phenomenal.  Perfectly cooked.  Nicely seasoned and a light char on the crust which had tons of flavor.  I get duck with some regularity.  This was the best duck I've had in town.  \n\nOur apps were a mixed bag.  We loved the fried okra (spears not slices) and salt/vinegar fries.  I was not a fan of the fry bread.  Tasted kind of bland to me.  And the bone marrow was ok.  They went too heavy on the caramelized onion toppings.  Easily removed, so nbd.\n\nI loved my dessert.  This bumped my experience up a notch when the dinner was starting to drag on.  It was the blueberry upside down cake.  First off, it wasn't deconstructed.  I do not care for deconstructed cake.  Dense cake with lots of blueberry and associated blueberry glaze.  It was topped with honey ice cream.  Excellent.  Totally recommend if you have a sweet tooth.\n\nWe thought our server was a dud.  She had a strange cadence.  I never knew if she was done talking or just getting started.  Our dinner was paced on the slow side.  From entree clean up to dessert drop off was waaaaaaay too long.  I almost canceled my dessert because we had all grown tired of waiting.  We also had some issues with drink refills.  That's a pet peeve.  I suffer from cenosillicaphobia.  It's a thing.    \n\nIn the end, a very solid culinary performance made up for some weak service.

We haven't really gone out to since this whole COVID 19 pandemic started and my girlfriend recently got surgery and last night she was finally up for going out to get some food so it was supposed to be a nice dinner date. Upon arriving I could tell they were on the busier side of most places around. There was a table right in front of the restaurant but we requested something by the heaters since it was starting to get a bit cold. The only table available by a heater seated 6. We confirmed it wouldn't be a problem since it was just my partner and I. We were reassured it would be no problem. So we sat down and looked up the online menu and started to decide what we would order. We then noticed a few people on staff kept walking around looking at us. It happened a few times. We started to feel weird thinking it was because there was just two of us sitting at this 6 people table. Turns out we were right. There was a group of 3 that they wanted to seat but options were limited. We got asked if it would be a problem if we moved, we agreed as long as it was near a heater and they said they had a table clearing up near one. Then a few minutes later the same guy came and said it wasn't a problem we could stay where we were. We asked if they were sure, we didn't have a problem moving but were once again reassured it was fine. We then noticed the group of 3 must work there or be friend of the staff because they were quickly brought a table out from inside and their drink order was taken. By this time it had been 30 or so minutes and the only time we were approached was to be asked to move. We waited a few more minutes and no one came. We noticed the groups of 3 was already ordering and we hadn't even had water brought out. We flagged down a waiter and expressed our frustration. He said he would be back and after another 5 minutes we decided to get up and leave.

Lesson learned. I ordered the two special rolls for the day, The crunchy roll and the orange fire roll. One was $12 and the other was 14. The ingredients sounded like a good combination, although they touted the Fire roll as being really hot, which is a bonus for my tastes. I brought the rolls home and they were fairly sized so the portion was adequate, but once my family and I actually ate them, disappointment reared it's ugly face. The quality of the ingredients was severely lacking. The crunch roll seemed like they used stale crumbs, the rice was almost doughy, and left your mouth coated with a dry doughy feeling which took from the other ingredients that should have saved the meal. The same issue with the rice went for the fire roll, only it was even more disappointing as it had salmon in the center and a beautiful slice of tuna on top. But looks can be deceiving, the sushi was actually not very fresh and it couldn't save the day, rather it only added to the sad meal. I'm not an avid sushi eater, but I've had it at least a hundred times in my life, and this was easily the worst I've ever had from an actual sushi restaurant (buffets and grocery stores don't count).

It was a birthday celebration and because of the number of us we were seated in a private room and had a set menu where we chose an entree  and the appetizers and desert were chosen for us.  The serves was impeccable,  I believe are server's name was Jose.   He was attentive, unobtrusive and friendly.  The serves was fast and all that was suppose to be hot did indeed arrive at the table hot.  The appetizers that came with the set menu were delicious and not a word was spoken at the table while everyone dug in and enjoyed the piri piri prawns, scallops, ricotta and chive filled piquillo peppers, manchego filled bacon wrapped dates and Mista salad ( tomatoes, mix greens cucumber and a light vinaigrette). The buns served were also a big hit with the group.  For the main coarse we had a choice of either a double boned rack of lamb , beef tenderloin served with roasted potatoes and a variety of other roasted vegetables or Alaskan sable fish on a bed of lobster risotto. The presentation was beautiful and sparked a high level of desire to dig in.   I knew that everyone was enjoying the meal when the table goes from a lot of chatter to dead silence while everyone proceeds to discover what is on their plate.  I had the sable fish because at times I will try something I would not have at home.   I loved the fish, it was smooth as silk with a lovely after taste. The risotto was too salty for me or maybe risotto is just not a dish for me. I serve lamb to my family often so they are use to the flavor.  Those that had the lamb enjoyed the meal although found it a little well done to what they are use to.  Those who had the beef tenderloin were completely happy with their meal.  Since this menu catered to an adult palate, it was kind of Sabor to offer a pasta dish to their young patrons.  My granddaughters, who I might add are extremely picky eaters, gobbled up their pasta (which consisted of broad pasta with either an Alfredo or marinara sauce) until they could eat no more.  All the portions were a generous size and left just enough room for desert.  Speaking of desert, in my opinion is never complete unless involves  chocolate and Sabor did not disappoint with their chocolate  cayenne mousse and a slice of house cheese cake with port cherries. Very decadent, a coffee and liqueur would have gone nicely with this desert.   I did not have any wine since I was driving but the wine list offered something for everyone and those that had the Malbec loved it.  Entrees run between $28 and $48, appetizers or tapas run between $6 and $22 .  Wine by the glass is between $16 and $21 for the 9 oz.  Didn't notice the 6 oz prices, why would I.  A bottle of wine will run anywhere between $40 and $400.  All in all we had a lovely experience at Sabor's. The ambiance is warm and the atmosphere is calming.  It is a great place for a family dinner as much as a great place for an intimate dinner for two or to catch up over dinner with friends.  \n I am looking forward to returning to try the seafood paella.  I would give Sabor a solid 4 1/2 star rating but Yelp will only allow whole numbers. Thank you Jose for your attentive serves and the little extras you  provided us.

Oh, well, at least I have Samosas.  Those lacked seasoning, were heavily breaded, and extremely greasy.  Truly just short of being inedible.\n\nThe main dishes were just so so.  No real heat to the Chicken Vindaloo.  The fish curry was not at all as described on the menu, in a thin sauce and tasting a tiny bit fishy.

Initially we were told we couldn't make a reservation for 8 as they didn't have any tables that could accommodate that size but when I called back a few days later, they took our reservation for 8 without question. We went with one of their private rooms and the table was really meant more for 6 but we squeezed 8 around it. It was nice being in our own private room and each room is uniquely decorated. Even though it's a private room, it's not quiet. Overall, it's pretty noisy in there. Their was a TV in the room (no sound) but music was blaring throughout the place. It did make it a little tough to have a conversation. Food was really good and fresh and portion sizes large! We started with the guacamole and mozzarella wedges which was all quickly devoured. For my entree, I went with the hearty Thai chicken salad and had plenty for leftovers the next day! My wife had the shrimp and fish tacos which she said was some of the best she has had and they were able to accommodate her gluten-free allergy by swapping out the tortillas for corn. My son loved his Wowee Burger. We wanted to try their desserts, but we were so full that we had to take a pass on this visit. Service was very good throughout. The biggest issue here is parking. They don't have a dedicated lot so it's parallel parking in the street, but we struggled to find an open spot and wound up parking 4-5 blocks away.

While we both enjoy cuisines that do not radically alter themselves in order to appeal to timid tastebuds, neither one of us shuns Sukhi's frozen samosas or Trader Joe's version of butter chicken or their garlic naan. We also both have no hesitation to shop for and make more complicated Indian dishes from scratch at home. This is to say that we are an easy, but also well educated, pair of diners.\n\nWe made an early dinner reservation, arrived hungry and were seated immediately. We started our repast with Indian Railway Peppers, deep fried wax chiles and Gobi Manchurian, cauliflower florests in a spicy, tangy Indochinese style sauce. Hari, the manager, seated us and served our appetizer, commenting that we seemed to like 'the spicy stuff.' Yes and perfectly spicy both dishes were! T. and I were practically thumb wrestling to see who got the last bites of each dish. \n\nTo go with our entrees, we chose garlic naan, Thanal bullet naan-another spicy item with chili-and peshwari walnut naan. The latter was something I'd never seen or tried before (it's made with coconut, sultanas and walnuts)  but will now make a point to eat whenever it's available and possibly try my hand at in my own kitchen.\n\nThe mains were tandoori pomfret, which is a whole fish with curry leaves (T. swooned over those) and kashmir chiles. The fish was tender and moist and we picked it clean like starving animals. Chicken chettinand was our second entree. I first had a baby eggplant version of this at Amma and was hooked. Thanal makes this with meltingly perfect boneless chicken cooked in an onion-tomato gravy flavored with chettinand masala and fresh curry leaves. While our rice was ample, we did not want to miss a drop of the juices and gravy from either dish so we ordered additional plain naan to aid in our gluttony and left absolutely nothing on any bowl or plate. The naans we tried, by the way, are all utterly superb and I could, if I was utterly shameless, order one of each and make a meal of just that, a chutney or two and a few gin and tonics. The thought of the crab naan has me salivating...\n\nHari and other servers checked in with us often, joked and chatted pleasantly and kept our water glasses full. Dessert was offered; as much as T. and I love rasmali, which is on the menu, due to our earlier grand feasting, we had to decline. \n\nT. chided me for keeping Thanal Tavern to myself for so long and then promptly ordered a lamb biryani to go for her next night's dinner.

Nothing to write home to mom about. Had a weird time here. I have a minor allergy to tree nuts and this place is making me feel like crap about it. Allergy is pretty managed, not severe or life threatening and I am A-okay when I just avoid eating nuts. Places that cook etc. in the same space are fine for me and I worked at an ice cream shop serving up nuts for 5+ years. I do not warn everywhere I go that I have an allergy because if a dish features nuts that's nearly always called out because it's a pretty known allergen and my life isn't at risk. When I do end up eating nuts, I become extremely uncomfortable but I'm not going to dive into my symptoms ha but I'll say that walnuts are the worst. \n\nThe ~pastry of the day~ was a zucchini muffin which was cool because you don't see those very often. My friend gave me a small bite and when put it down I saw a walnut baked in and knew I was about to have a time. Was traveling that day and was saved when my friend had a spare claritin. I was pretty disappointed that there was no mention that this was a zucchini nut muffin because I could have just not taken a bite. We told our waiter who gave an apology because what else was he going to say? The manager noticed our table's distress and reaction to this lack of remorse and came over to address the situation which from what I got from it, was that it was on me for not mentioning my nut allergy at the onset of the meal. That was MADDENING! Sure, I can ask and let everyone know, but how about the server ask if anyone has an allergy too? Or better yet, label the item on the menu (not the special menu which was where this was) as containing such. Putting a disclaimer at the bottom of the main menu that 1. doesn't mention nuts only shellfish and gluten and 2. just requests the customer speak up doesn't cover any kind of base. You can't guarantee someone reads and you also aren't stating everything! We were appalled that there was no accountability from the restaurant and that not listing that muffin as containing nuts was the bigger issue for me over not having a conversation, which is something I don't typically have to do because allergens are stated. \n\nI'm upset too because the business owner replied to another review on my friend's experience here and called my eating at a restaurant and not saying \"I can't eat nuts\" as \"reckless and disrespectful\" and that I need to take responsibility for myself. What good does it do to say that to a paying customer? Where is the remorse? If you weren't going to print the allergen on the menu, at least let the team know that day that there are nuts in the baked good. I'm sorry I didn't come in with my allergy on my sleeve that day but I'm even more sorry that an establishment had the reaction that they did over someone else's discomfort. It's one thing to not state that this dish has nuts but it turned into a completely other issue when the reaction from the business was to shift the fault onto the customer.

Had to acknowledge this multiple times before the owner was able to understand where we were coming from and offer an apology. \n\nThe food was quite delicious and the coffee I got didn't taste watered down, which is often a problem with the iced coffee at restaurants.  I ordered the Zippity Omelet which was well stuffed (maybe a little bit too much cheese) with fresh ingredients.\n\nThe latkes and fresh applesauce were the stars of the meal. The applesauce had a wonderful, rich texture and paired well with the latkes. \n\nI also really enjoyed the aforementioned zuchini NUT muffin as I am not allergic to walnuts.  \n\nMy review would be lower due to the problems we had with the manager and owner but I did find the food to be fresh and delicious. The chef wasn't our problem here, hence the 4 star review.", "date": "2019-05-13 14:52:24", "user": {"name": "Stephanie", "review_count": 6, "yelping_since": "2018-09-19 16:22:29", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.71, "fans": 0}}, {"review_id": "JTeR9wzcNH5dzClfgtCOmA", "user_id": "4MrNUuIotcM8dHMK2IplHg", "business_id": "sf-KdXHB5nxfNjl2uUpI6Q", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 5, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "text": "Came here the other day with family and friends for a quick bite after shopping all day. We had a great time and were really happy to find this spot! We chose this restaurant based on the abundantly positive reviews and were inspired by the story behind the eatery. As young adults, it was really cool to find a spot managed by, staffed by, and created by people just like us. \n\nThe food was rather good. I wish I had photos to share, but my friend and I split the egg sandwich and grilled cheese. I was blown away by the homemade apple sauce, too. I actually hate apple sauce, and I definitely surprised myself by eating the whole side of the stuff. \n\nThe reason I can't give this restaurant a full 5 stars has to do with a food allergy incident we experienced. One of my friends has an allergy to tree nuts. Certainly not life threatening, but enough to cause discomfort. She will typically mention her allergy when eating out, but on this day she forgot. I think because we were exhausted and hungry, we were just excited for good food and jumped the gun on ordering right away. \n\nMy friend wanted to try a bite of my sister's zucchini muffin and was surprised to find nuts were baked into the muffin. She had a slight reaction from the ingestion and used an antihistamine to counter the reaction. Knowing we had made a mistake in not mentioning the allergen or reading the menu carefully, we took a second look at the menu and realized the daily printed menu had no mention of nuts in the muffin, and the brunch menu had mention of shellfish and gluten allergens, but no mention of tree nuts. We understand restaurants are not required to list food allergens on their menus, but seeing the mention of other food allergens without any mention of tree nuts made us feel that we should mention something to the staff. The specials menu is printed regularly and we felt it might be wise to add mention of tree nuts in the event that this situation occurred again. \n\nOur waiter acknowledged that it was a good idea to write something on the menu, but didn't follow up with anything actionable (like saying he brought it to management or that anything ultimately would/wouldn't be done). Upon receiving the check, we decided to leave a comment on the \"How Was Your Experience?\" card. We felt this was the appropriate space to leave a suggestion on representation of food allergens. \n\nA manager noticed us discussing what to write and came by to ask about our experience. We told her about how much we enjoyed the food but how we wished something had been written about food allergens. Instead of agreeing, apologizing, or giving us an actionable response, the manager told us that it was our responsibility to disclose food allergies before ordering. Again, we understand that it falls in the responsibility of the person allergic to certain foods to disclose their allergies, but we were only trying to recommend a second line of action that would help the restaurant prevent any issues in the future. The manager was rather dismissive and did not suggest that anything would change in the future. \n\nI would just like to be clear to close out this review: we had a very positive dining experience between the delicious food and friendly waitstaff. However, we could not help but feel disregarded by the employees when bringing up a valid concern and suggestion. It is logical to expect someone with a food allergy to say something. But for the occasions when the food allergy isn't so severe, and the restaurant is already taking the time to represent OTHER food allergens, it is fair to make a suggestion about adding \"tree nuts\" to the list of allergens, especially when they're a main ingredient in a dish that doesn't always include tree nuts. We accept responsibility on our behalf, but we wish someone from management or the staff would do the same. \n\nI've attached photos of the brunch menu and daily menu.", "date": "2019-05-13 14:52:04", "user": {"name": "John", "review_count": 13, "yelping_since": "2015-06-09 17:47:23", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.85, "fans": 1}}, {"review_id": "SQfvXDKum2-19jC4yhxjeQ", "user_id": "WqPpz5wydGQVVETOBGFGkQ", "business_id": "sf-KdXHB5nxfNjl2uUpI6Q", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 4, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "text": "Had lunch in this quaint restaurant.

We were concerned another patron may also have exposure to the nuts so we mentioned it to the manager who came to the table to ask about our lunch experience. We explained our concern and she said there were only nuts used for garnish and that it was a last minute addition and that next time we should mention the allergy ahead of time.

You're going to hear things you don't like & things that make you incredibly frustrated- not every review is going to be positive. The best thing to do is to listen to your customers and make sure their needs are met. Thank you for taking the time to apologize and respond to us all individually.\nUPDATE: Owner responded to my review with hostility & victim blaming. \"It is printed on the menu for that very reason\" THATS THE ISSUE !! THE FACT THAT NUTS WERE IN THE MUFFIN WAS NOT PRINTED ON THE MENU. WE HAVE PHOTOS OF THE MENU. This is NOT how you run a business. Your staff should be asking about food allergies. As a business owner, YOU should be taking every precaution necessary. If you had a nut brownie on the menu, you'd say \"brownie with nuts\" if you had banana NUT bread you'd mention nuts, why is this any different? Why can't you just admit that you did not mention the fact that there were nuts on the muffin? We were very kind given the entire situation & the response we received from the waiter, manager & now the owner have been both disrespectful & honestly very concerning. This place does not care about their patrons and would rather ARGUE with paying customers & be dismissive and rude than accept the fact and admit to the fact that they are in the wrong. I've attached two photos- one of the muffin listing (never mentioning nuts) & one of the menu where it too, does not mention anything about nut allergies. Skylar, you're not as intelligent as you think you are. & this is not how you treat people never-mind customers. \nI would have given it a 4 if the situation that I'm about to explain hadn't had happened. \nThe food was fantastic. \nHowever, our waiter lacked social skills & when we had our issue that we ran into he did not show any signs of remorse.\n\nThe issue; \n\nWhen we all ordered our food we were informed it came with our choice of bread or a pastry - the pastry of the day was a zucchini muffin- harmless, sounds yummy etc. very excited. \nWhen our food arrived we all ate it and were enjoying ourselves when my sisters girlfriend noticed her mouth began to tingle. After looking at the muffin, she realized they had nuts in them- she has a nut allergy. \nNow, this allergy isn't severe enough to kill her instantly - but it is severe enough to the point where if I hadn't had allergy medicine, she would have had to go to the hospital. \nOur issue came with the fact that after this happened, we looked at the menus on the table and realizEd that neither our waiter nor the menu specified that the muffins contained nuts. we decided to inform our waiter, who- like I mentioned before- had 0 remorse. He didn't even apologize. We didn't tell him in a rude manner either- we simply said hey just for the next table that comes in, make sure you mention that there are nuts so this doesn't happen to someone with an even more severe allergy. He said \"sure sure ok\" and walked away. \nWe then were approached by the owner (or manager, couldn't tell) who I believe overheard us discussing it. When we explained the situation she said to us \"well, did you mention to the waiter that you had a food allergy?\" Right then and there I knew this place wasn't a professional spot. \nI have worked at numerous restaurants throughout my life and every time we were told to mention nuts and shell fish AND to ASK our table if there were any allergies we should be aware of- even if they didn't order anything that would seem like it contained anything in it. JUST IN CASE. \nAlso what the hell kind of a business tries to justify their own mistake like that? Why not just own up to it and say \"you know what, you're right- that should be listed on the menu and I will note that change and make sure all of our staff checks with our future tables before we serve them.\" That would have been a simple, easy, effective solution. Instead she put the blame on US - the CUSTOMER!!! \nI live in NYC so maybe there people are a little better at being courteous and doing the right thing to please their customers and ensure a return, but this woman did not do that. No \"I'll take $10 off the bill\" no \"I'll take that item off of your bill as an apology\" not even a regular apology!!!!!! \nCompletely unprofessional and rude. We stayed very calm and kind throughout the entire ordeal, but the experience we dealt with is not how I'd expect any restaurant to treat their customers. Will not be returning, am upset we gave them any sort of business, and the owner, manager, whatever she was- needs to be re-taught customer service because clearly she doesn't understand how to run a business properly.", "date": "2019-05-12 20:00:54", "user": {"name": "Courtney", "review_count": 164, "yelping_since": "2016-05-16 21:50:41", "elite": "2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.07, "fans": 12}}, {"review_id": "At0KNRwo4GQhognK7rOPNA", "user_id": "6CiRDJF4z3-E-Nc-3CHlmw", "business_id": "sf-KdXHB5nxfNjl2uUpI6Q", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Food is excellent, portions on the small side though.

It was my second time dining here and they didn't disappoint. We had the latest reservation of the day so they were out of some of the special items BUT that was okay because they had what I came for; Keto Breakfast and Brussels sprouts.\n\nThe biscuits and gravy (Keto breakfast) was extremely tasty. I loved the buttery flavor of the biscuits. The gravy wasn't the traditional heavy thick white gravy associated with B&G which was fine; didn't miss it due to the flavorful sausage. Eggs were cooked perfectly; slightly runny yolk that helped thicken the sauce/gravy.\n\nThe Brussels sprouts were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The added bacon and shishito peppers added the right amount of salt and heat to balance some of the fattiness.\n\nHonorable mentions: \n* Bacon chips with guacamole - guacamole was fresh and had lots of lime..loved the zing. Would've liked the bacon to be a little saltier but that's a personal preference \n\n* Sweet potato wedges - samples this; like the Brussels they had a lovely crisp exterior. The flesh was tender and creamy. Could've gone without the sauces, again a personal preference\n\n*Primal pizza - my mother had this behemoth of a pizza; it's definitely shareable. She enjoyed the pizza and thought the crust had the right amount of chew. She kosher on this for two days, was still tasty by day 3!\n\nOverall Nook Paleo has made it to my favorites list.

It wasn't too sweet, but it enhanced the overall flavor of the dish. The other person with me ordered a paleo vegetable and mozzarella pizza. The toppings looked fresh, and the pizza was thin crust. Unfortunately, the edges and bottom of the crust were blackened. They were gracious to exclude the pizza from the bill and make another pizza with a traditional crust. The second pizza was not burnt, and tasted wonderfully. The server and manager said that it is typical for the paleo crust to have black edges. I can understand as the edges of a thin crust are the thinnest part of the pizza, but the bottom was unacceptable to eat and enjoy of the first pizza. Nut flours are more fragile to cook with than traditional flours such as wheat. My guess is that the wood stove is too hot for the fragility of nut flour in comparison to a paleo pizza being cooked in a conventional oven. If you go to the diner and would like a pizza, I'd suggest the traditional non-paleo crust. Or better yet, try the chicken and waffles.

It just has a better combo for the flavor. The seared tuna was ok - although ours was a bit cold. \n\nBut they had kombucha, they had excellent service and kind managers to specifically talk to us about whole30 and it's great to have a restaurant of this caliber focused on helping this who are attempting to better themselves by eating healthy. \n\nGood location downtown, nice ambiance.

I have to provide an update because I had such a terrible experience last night. My husband and I ordered the sambaritas that I mentioned in my original review and they came out in red Solo cups with no cocktail shakers on the side. I asked where the regular glassware was and the waitress said that the bar was really busy so everyone was getting Solo cups. I looked around and my eye detector test determined that was a lie. \n\nI took a sip of the drink and noticed that it was NOT a sambarita. There was tons of sweet-n-sour mix which is not part of the recipe. I told the waitress about that issue as well. She looked confused and asked if I wanted to speak to the manager. I said yes. The manager strolled over about 10 minutes later and just stood by the table looking at us. No introduction, no \"I heard there was an issue with your drinks\", just a smug face. Oooookk, I thought. So I began my long explanation. She told me that her \"ace bartenders\" were working and that they made the drink correctly. I asked her if she was back there when they made it. I told her that the drink tastes nothing like it normally does. She said sambaritas have Patr\u00f3n and Patr\u00f3n is very expensive. (Gee thanks for the lesson. Never knew that. -__- ) She said she will have to charge us for a shot. After going back and forth, she begrudgingly offered to make new drinks, but I said I didn't want another one if it was going to taste exactly like the one I had AND be delivered in a red Solo cup. \n\nI was just appalled by her lack of professionalism. Horrible manager. She should have apologized about the mistake instead of arguing that her bartenders didn't do anything wrong. She should've offered to bring out new drinks in the beginning and should've ensured they were made correctly. And they should have been free, in my opinion, especially for a regular like me.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the $5 nacho special was extremely dry with barely any queso or other toppings.

Oh, and that same handyman made the seats, which creaked and groaned and swayed more than a skyscraper's 100th floor. In this amateur critic's opinion, an upscale dining experience is undermined  by feeling the furniture will fall apart at any moment. \n\nFar and away, the best part of Sycamore is the food. Portions were adequate (even generous considering the voguish nature of the dishes), well-executed, and delicious. For my first course, I ordered the 'Mushrooms on Toast', which impressed me with its earthy and rich tastes and a light, yet satisfying quality. My main course, the not-always-available pork chop, was a delight. Juicy and flavorful in ways pork seldom is, the filling portion was worthy of building a meal around. Rounding out the meal was my choice of a deconstructed lemon pie. I admit, I was skeptical at first. How could a plate of whipped cream and scant smears of reduction be satisfying? I was so happy to be proven wrong, so much so that I may have to re-evaluate how I see desert entirely. \n\nIn the end it's not the cuisine which smears Sycamore, but its menu and its service. It's a BYO, going so far as to offer cocktails sans liquor (with the idea that you bring your own presumably tiny bottles). Although an interesting concept on paper, in practice it seems out of place with the trendy, full-service experience they otherwise propose. The service, while adequate when the room was less crowded, rapidly deteriorated as the night went on and the place filled up. Signs of understaffing and inexperienced staffing (many of them looked in high school or just out) hurt our group's experience to the point where several items were taken off our bill in apology. \n\nSycamore is not for everyone. It's menu is cuisine couture prepared by a knowing hand; it's front of house staffed by by last year's local high school graduates.

There were many, many high points, but also some not so much. \n\nThe location of this place is a little odd. But after reading so many great reviews, I decided to give it a go. I was treating my husband to a make-up birthday dinner, and we drove a long distance to get here, coming all the way from Northeast Philadelphia. It was most certainly worth the trip. We decided to throw caution to the wind and go with the $29 prix fixe. My husband was worried about it because he doesn't like salmon (clearly because he is crazy), but I was pleased when I asked the server to exclude any salmon selections and he did not seem to mind at all.\n\nNot to get too much into specifics, because it's a varied menu anyway, but everything we had was very unique, inspired and seriously magnificent. There were several courses- amuse, bread, salad, mezze, entree, cheese and dessert. The portion sizes were much larger than I had anticipated as well. Quite impressive for only $29! Seriously, if I were judging Sycamore on food alone, I would be giving 5 stars without hesitation.\n\nAlas, there were a few misses. Sycamore prepares a few different cocktail mixers to accompany whatever spirits you've decided to bring. We tried two different shakers, Indian Ocean and Moscow Mule. I feel like these were conceptually very good, just executed poorly. Both had waaaaaay too much citrus. We couldn't even finish the second shaker because we were both starting to experience terrible heartburn. But like I said, I think this is a small error in execution that could be easily adjusted. \n\nThen there was the service. I won't say that the service was at all poor, just a little...off. The servers (both male) were both dressed khaki pants and non-matching sweaters, so it really just looked like street clothes to me. I can kind of get what they are going for with this, but then the bus-girl was wearing all black. I feel like there really needs to be some kind of cohesiveness with the uniforms. It's a small detail I know, but I certainly noticed it. Also, at one point we asked to see the menu again to look over the mixers, and the server completely forgot to come back and check on us to see if we wanted to order any of the drinks we had been looking at.\n\nAt the end of the day, Sycamore is a lovely restaurant that really hope does well.

The Mayfield is nestled in Edmonton's West side and treats its guests to an all you can eat buffet followed by live theatre. I was lucky to get to check out the show Hair and it was quite the production!\n\nLive vocals and a entire band on stage completed the retro vibe of Hair. The lighting and costumes transported you right back to a time where peace and love ran free. I could not believe the talent of each of the cast members. They all really brought it on opening night and brought the house down. It was a world class production and I was so happy to get to see it!\n\nNow if your tummy is rumbling you may be wondering about the food. The all you can eat buffet is in a huge room at the back of the theatre. Your first stop is going to be at this delicious buffet after you have been seated and met one of the great wait staff. You eat all of your meal before your show in about a 2 hour time frame, so make sure to pace yourself! There is something for everyone and the menu changes with the production but they always have a cut of beef, chicken, fish and their amazing desserts. I definitely did not leave that establishment hungry.  I had a bruschetta chicken, prime rib, Yorkshire pudding along with salads and desserts. I think you can check the menu online before hand if you are curious.\n\nIt was a fantastic night out. This would be perfect for a nice date night, girls night or just a treat yourself evening.

The best part of the buffet... in my humble opinion... is the DESSERT!!! Every. Single. Time. I am blown away. Sour cherry panna cotta, bread puddings, crumbles, mousses, cheesecakes. Good grief.  Pro tip - arrive at 6pm to start eating, then around 7:30pm, before the buffet closes at 7:45pm, grab yourself a plate of whatever you might want to snack on during the show. \n\nFor the price, you can't beat the Mayfield.

I had heard great things about the restaurant, so we were looking forward to the evening.  Bottom line, this was a mixed experience and so at best the overall rating is 3 stars.  First, when we entered the restaurant - no one was at the desk.  We waited and finally I got the attention of the bartender who had someone from the back come out to seat us and confirm our reservation.  So I immediately sense there is something off.  Now, you should know that the food did not drop their star rating.  It is really how they got a 3.  The Pappardelle pasta was delicious as was the calamari and the Filet Mignon.  The Bluecoat martinis were done perfectly and we had good pours of wine.  So why do I give it only 3 stars?  It was our server.  He seemed as if he were \"performing\" a theatrical piece of his own design with grand gestures and a poorly written script -- rather than serving.  Every interaction came with some attempt at wit and charm, but it seemed strained and contrived.  The \"young man\" and the \"petite young lady\" lines might have worked a few decades ago on us, but they were a bit off putting now!  Yet, it wasn't just the old trite lines; it was the lack of attention.  I can never understand when a server is at another nearby table and never looks in your direction - to save them a trip, to see if you need anything, etc.  This server had that down to a science - he never looked at us unless we waved in his direction.  So when I saw the calamari come out of the kitchen; I also saw it sit, and sit, and sit on the counter.  Our server was nowhere to be found.  Finally; another server swooped it up and delivered it to our table.  When we pointed out it was cold - this new server - quite professionally said he would have them make a new batch and also made some rather generous adjustments to our bill.  The food was quite good.  The second server was attentive and professional, but alas our original server returned to close out the meal.  The message to management - if I wanted \"dinner theatre\" I would have gone somewhere else that night.  Also, one of the reasons I chose this restaurant was because it offered a discount on the expensive center city parking.  Never once did anyone ask us \"where did we park,\" or \"are you seeing a show\" - anytime we are in NYC to see a show, they always ask us this - usually the server does it.  Well I guess our server was too busy being his own show to ask about us and we forgot to mention it.

One bad apple shouldn't spoil the bunch or a good restaurants reputation.", "date": "2015-12-18 00:14:31", "user": {"name": "Jenny", "review_count": 14, "yelping_since": "2014-10-20 22:33:52", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.26, "fans": 2}}, {"review_id": "PouuwV0N0ziDrv0sJjtbXQ", "user_id": "g54vHWBC9WftTq1LBKKiEg", "business_id": "eZ-t73r7ETHjyclRB7SnwQ", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "We ate here last night for our anniversary dinner and were so excited to try a new (to us) place! Long story short, we were underwhelmed.\n\nIf you don't feel like reading the novel that is to come, here's the short: Food: 4/5 stars, Service -1/5 stars, ambiance, 3/5\n\nWhen he made reservations he told them we were coming for our anniversary. Usually places do something for you to celebrate with you, like seat you at a more private or romantic table or at least a verbal mention. No acknowledgement. No big deal, we don't need a standing ovation, it's just that most places realize that you do it up big for a special event that you took the time to mention, and that they're lucky you chose them. The hostess was sweet and sat us right away, didn't ask to take our coats. \nWe were seated by the window facing the street, which would have been nice except that these are usually doors that are open for open air seating. They were sealed closed with a clear tape, but there was a literal wind blowing the menu insert and my hair around. It's December, I'm in a cocktail dress. You put us next to a windy freezing door in an otherwise empty restaurant? After about 5 minutes no one had come over (there was only 1 other table in the place) so my boyfriend tracked down the hostess and asked her to move us. She did right away and the new table was great (and at a comfortable temperature), So now we're back on track!\nWe wait for awhile and finally an older blonde woman comes over and stands awkwardly far away from our table and says, \"get you a drink?\" Once we realized she was speaking to us, we asked for a drink menu. \"don't you have one?\" well, no, or we wouldn't have asked you. She returned, dropped it off and left us to decide. When she came back, I ordered a glass of wine and she asked me to repeat myself twice. You have 5-6 wines on the menu, how is this so difficult? So after more confusion and repeating, she leaves to get our glasses of wine. She brings them and tells us the special. I'm going to assume she meant chicken cacciatore soup but what she said was chicken skatatory soup. We pass on that, and I ask to have the salmon dish, without salmon, but with a different protein (that is listed as the same price). You would have thought I asked her to solve a difficult math problem. She made a big deal of it and finally agreed to ask the kitchen. She walked 10 feet away and asked and the guy in the kitchen said, \"yeah, no problem\" and was not at all phased, did not seem upset. She comes back and tells us we're ok, then leaves us to our wine. A bus boy brings us some bread in a cloth covered basket and it looks delicious! I pick it up to try it and it is ice cold. So why the basket? To keep it cold? Super disappointed. \nFood comes in a timely manner and is delicious. If there was a critique at all it would be that the scallops were a touch overdone, but were still very enjoyable. Ok, starting to forget about the negative stuff, back to enjoying our anniversary!\nShe comes and asks if we want dessert. I remember that on the dessert menu were also dessert drinks and I ask her for a dessert menu. She looks up at the ceiling and starts rattling off desserts. I tell her that I don't want dessert, but I do want a dessert drink, which was listed on the dessert menu. This is of course an enormous inconvenience. We get the menu and I order a boozy coffee with no whipped cream. Guess how she delivered it to me? Yep, a mountain of whipped cream. When I point out that I asked for none, she corrected me and told me that I asked FOR whipped cream. I assured her that I did not, and pointed out that the only reason I asked for NONE was because the menu lists that it comes with and I don't like whipped cream. So again, this is a huge ordeal as she huffs 6 feet over to the bar to have another one made. I'd like to point out that we were her ONLY table. The table that was there when we were seated was gone and another younger blonde waitress was tending to a table of 2, the only other table in the place. At no point was she even remotely friendly. At no point did she smile. This may have been the worst service I've ever had, and if not, it comes close. So, if you're looking for a special place to celebrate a special event, think twice about this place. We'd go back again if she wasn't there.", "date": "2015-12-08 04:06:55", "user": {"name": "Krystal", "review_count": 235, "yelping_since": "2011-06-15 21:55:14", "elite": "2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 3.76, "fans": 13}}, {"review_id": "1ggPgHUGI4h00_enoKQh8w", "user_id": "cfHvu-jXR9SQKlVkJdF0cA", "business_id": "eZ-t73r7ETHjyclRB7SnwQ", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Friday the 13th didn't hinder another great meal at bliss!!

So what I noticed is lots of restaurants close fairly early and driving up and down the street plus walking in asking if restaurants are opened !! And most close early !! So Finally found this Thai Restaurant opened past 8:30pm and I walk in and was seated right away and it was really slow because it was 43 degrees outside and freezing so I guess no one wants to be outside eating !! Well for us we were fairly hungry and needed some food in our stomach !! As a foodie I always enjoy trying new restaurants and eating at new places !! So I Decided on ordering the Pan Thai Noodles and I have to say it is one of the more popular dishes here !! Cooked well and flavorful !! Next I got some appetizers which were the delicious Spring Rolls which they cut in pieces for you to dip into there delicious Peanut Sauce which comes on the side !! Those spring rolls were yummy !! Last I got the Red meat Wonton Soup which hit the spot !! Tasted pretty dang good !! I also noticed the decor was decorated with a lot of elephants around and I guess it's the symbol for this Restaurant !! But I do suggest you give it a try and enjoy the delicious Thai food they serve here !! One more thing the parking was not bad but you have to park on the side street and the first 90 Minutes are Free !! Well my overall experience was good and I definitely recommend this Restaurant to everyone to try  !!

This establishment strongly encourages social distancing and offers both indoor and outdoor dining. Wonz here I chose to sit at the bar (my favorite place to sit and eat) The bartenders we're really nice. This establishment has a ordering system if you want alcoholic beverages you must water from the bar, and if you want food you must track down a waitress so that she can take your order. I want to see that I ordered The spicy pick and pool shrimp, a half dozen oysters on the shell, and garlic mussels in white wine. The shrimp were absolutely delicious, The mussel broth was very scrumptious with a perfect amount of garlic. Once done with those dishes I then ordered the buffalo shrimp along with the 1lb of snow crab legs. The buffalo shrimp were good however they weren't better than the pick and pool trip. The pound of snow crab's came with Broccoli, corn, and potatoes In a special lemon garlic Cajun sauce. The crabs were steamed perfectly and the seasoning for the vegetables was absolutely amazing. This is definitely a spot that I will revisit in the near future.

I found them on Yelp and all of the photos on Yelp was making me drool, unfortunately the actual food was beyond unappetizing. \n\nFirst and foremost, first impression means a lot. When a customer walk in, instead of a greeting, my hub was ignored. If you say the guys behind my hub were ignored also, then it is a \"norm\", but that wasn't the case, both of the waiters greeted the 2 guys behind my hubby. But what about my hub? He was the first person walking in and waited for someone to acknowledge him....... Btw both of those guys were white, I don't want to play the race card but this is unacceptable. Both of the waiters continue to ignore my hub, so my hub left and ask me to call. I called and the counter girl say she just brung out the food, so my hubby went back inside. Then my hub came back out, and say they said my food is not ready.... I was like ????? You told me it was ready.... My hub went back in after a 3rd attempt and finally got our food.\n\nWhen we got home, one of the bag broke and my platters fell onto the ground. I know I order oysters but the least you can do is to ensure my bag doesn't break . We ordered fresh fried mozzarella, dozens of raw oysters, double lobster mac and cheese, double clam chowder, shrimp and scallop alfredo, seafood jambalaya, and bayside seafood combo. \n\nThe clam chowder was sour, I tasted one and it had a sour taste to it, it seem like it was sitting in a pot all day. Oysters got pieces of shells in it, I'm trying to eat the oyster not with the shell too. Fried fresh mozzarella and lobster mac and cheese were lukewarm, seems like it was sitting on their counter for a while. We only saw one piece of lobster meat on 1 of our lobster mac.  Shrimp and scallops alfredo got a weird taste, especially the scallops. Shrimps tasted frozen and rough in texture, and the scallops got a nasty stench to it...... Seafood jambalaya and bayside pot were also rough in texture. \n\nIt is not like our bill was $50, our total is around $164, is that a way to get treated at a restaurant?

They have so many great unique options available: meat lovers, vegetarian, vegan, halal, and gluten-free. Not too many sandwich spots that offer something for everyone and their dietary needs. All sandwiches are served hot with lettuce, tomato, and their dirty sauce (creamy garlic aioli - dairy free but contains egg). I always get extra because it's that good! You can add freebies to your sandwich too: red onions, banana peppers, jalape\u00f1os, mustard, and pickles. \n\nFor gluten-free, they have a delicious option for an extra $2.00. This is my personal choice, since me and gluten are not friends. One of the better gluten-free breads I've had. \n\nThe Menage a Trois is my favorite! How can you not love halal chicken, honey mustard, bbq sauce, real honey, pepper jack, swiss, and cheddar all on one sandwich! The Hunter Pence, We're Just Friends are all good meat sandwiches. James & The Giant Peach and The Time Traveler's Wife are the best vegan sandwiches! \n\nDon't forget to grab a bag of Zapp's Potato Chips (tasty bag of goodness from Louisiana). Side note: they sell a bag of their house made famous dutch crunch bread in bags of six for $4.99. \n\nCatering: If you need some sandwiches, this is a great option! \n\nLastly, you will always get a sweet treat in your bag.

However, Tuk Tuk Thai is has impressed me so much that I am willing to go outside my comfort zone and order items aside from curry, and I haven't been disappointed yet! My most recent trip was this past weekend, and I decided to try their Pad Char Pla, which is Thai catfish battered and fried with aromatic seasoning and mixed with vegetables. It tasted even better than it smelled, and it smelled amazing! The texture of the fish was PERFECT, super crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside, and the sauce it was cooked in was super flavorful. I have to compliment this place for having great tasting meals as well as generous portion sizes - I have a habit of trying to eat everything on my plate but I'm pretty sure I always have to get a to go box every time I have come here. In the past I have also tried their chicken wings and coco pumpkin fries - both of which are absolutely delicious; their fried options are definitely always a treat and are cooked perfectly. And of course all the curry options I have tried have also been delightful - pumpkin, green, khao soi, and panang - all a great mix of sweet and spicy with distinct flavor profiles. \n\nI also love when a restaurant has unique beverage options - so far my favorite drink here is their fresh strawberry lemonade. Do not be fooled, this is not your average bottled pink lemonade. The strawberry flavor is very prominent and refreshing, and it also seems to have a hint of carbonation in it, and I love carbonated drinks so I adore this drink - it is a perfect mix of sweet and tart and it really hits the spot when it's hot outside. I have tried their Thai iced coffee which is strong and very good; I think it would be a favorite for most coffee lovers, but not for people who like their coffee with lots of sugar and cream to hide the bitterness, bc theirs is quite strong. I have also tried the Thai iced tea, and while I do like it, I will have to warn people who are expecting the bright orange and white mixed drink that is often seen at other Thai places; Tuk Tuk Thai's Thai tea is much less sweet and more subtle than the ones at other Thai restaurants. \n\nOverall I love this place and have come back many times, and as always I just wish I didn't live so far away from it! My only gripe is that getting rice for most meals does cost extra (I believe it's around $2). Do I pay for it every time? Yes! I just wish I didn't have to since most other similar restaurants offer rice as a complimentary side dish. But that really is my only issue, and it's a small one; I still think this place is worth coming back to again and again because their menu is diverse and everything I've had so far is super tasty, especially compared to other Thai restaurants in Tucson.

Wagyu Beef Carpaccio: this was surprisingly tasty and fresh. I have no complaints, it exceeded expectations!  \n\n2. Scallop Special: the flavor was good, but it didn't take long for the butter/oil the scallops sat in to harden into sickly clumps. Also, the portion was small small small small small, which is something I don't generally complain about because I really do believe quality is more important than quantity, but I hate that the restaurant tried to hide how half the container didn't have scallops by covering the empty side with bread.\n\n3. Tortellini Special: now THIS dish ruffled my feathers. Five tortellini is standard at any modern/higher-end restaurant, but these tortellini were pathetic. And I don't say that mean-spiritedly, they were just cold mouthfuls of dough with barely a drop (check out the pictures; no Italian grandmother would approve!) of filling.\n\n4. Orecchiette: great flavors, but again, the portion was small small small small small. Quality was definitely better than quantity here, but the quantity was honestly jarring. \n\nSo I'm a \"meh.\" There are definitely more expensive places in Philly with small portions too, but I've truly never been shocked by how small portions are at a restaurant except for at Hearthside.", "date": "2021-08-17 16:04:10", "user": {"name": "Brett", "review_count": 97, "yelping_since": "2021-05-30 23:49:04", "elite": "2021", "average_stars": 4.4, "fans": 1}}, {"review_id": "ENGzdKXKouHkw4qb5GxI2Q", "user_id": "voPPdRZ7kZ05iJOkRhOBaw", "business_id": "TCAaeZi4m_RwUTTbZseRmg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "A\nAmazing as always!

There is a lot of hype as you read articles in Philly Mag or reviews on Yelp, but it lives up to all the expectations.\n\nLet's start with the service - top notch. Friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, the whole nine. They went above and beyond to offer vegetarian options for the entree.\n\nThe atmosphere is upbeat and exciting. Great music playlist, open air space, you can watch the chefs cook and prepare food pretty much from anywhere in the restaurant. The interior is lined with candles and wood finishings - super comfortable. We even felt this way during COVID, all the seating was spread out or blocked off with plexiglass. All tables came with personal hand sanitizer. \n\nNow the food...where to begin, where to begin. We absolutely splurged on this meal and did not regret it one bit. The menu is sophisticated, the plating is elegant, seeing it from the menu to being executed on the plate is true art.\n\nAppetizers:\n- wagyu beef carpaccio: this was my first time trying a dish like this. If I could describe the dish in one word, I would say \"fresh.\" The beef was soft and earthy, topped with crunchy vegetables that really gave it a nice pop.\n\n- coconut curry mussels: this is a big dish for an appetizer, could easily be an entree. The nice thing is that the coconut curry sauce is light (compared to a red/diavolo sauce) so it didn't quite fill me up. The lemongrass focaccia was a really nice touch, and paired nicely with soaking up the juice.\n\n- black truffle risotto: unbelievable!! Hand-made pasta in a black truffle cream sauce with roasted artichokes - perfect combination of creamy and crunchy. Very filling and definitely shareable.\n\n- orecchiette: wow - I could have eaten this 10 times over. Thick and creamy pasta, packed with a spicy punch from the long hots, but not overpowering as it was matched with the savory earthy flavors of the fennel sausage & broccoli rabe. \n\n- mushrooms: can't say enough good things about this. They based the framework of the meal around the scottish salmon dish - shitaake mushrooms were prepared on a bed of vegetable foie gras and finished with a miso pho broth. Out of this world!! So appreciated their accomodation to a vegetarian request and the use of local, seasonal produce.\n \n- smoked pork chop: this was a home-run for me. Really slick plating, packed with flavor. The pork was cooked perfectly, and the juicy meat was matched with a delicious spicy/crunchy coating. Furthermore, the apple chutney really cut the savory/salty flavor of the pork and provided a nice fresh touch to the dish. \n\nFrom start to finish, I was just totally impressed. Would highly recommend checking this place out!\n\nOn the plus side - it is BYO! So take into consideration what you would save on drinks, and get that extra appetizer (or 2)", "date": "2021-01-26 03:23:38", "user": {"name": "Vincent", "review_count": 206, "yelping_since": "2020-01-28 03:25:01", "elite": "20,20,2021", "average_stars": 3.96, "fans": 11}}, {"review_id": "2ciQniDEepU03WtDWEjv3Q", "user_id": "kVbZDcESAMrQ7pFGaaYk1Q", "business_id": "TCAaeZi4m_RwUTTbZseRmg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Keywords: 40 Oz.

We ordered the new risotto and the aforementioned porterhouse for two.  The risotto had truffle and Jerusalem artichokes.  It was very interesting; while it lacked in the truffle flavor, i enjoyed the artichokes in the risotto and overall it really acted more like a carb for the main entree, the porterhouse.  I don't exaggerate on Yelp often, but this was the BEST steak I have had from a restaurant during the pandemic.  It was cooked perfectly and seasoned amazingly.  The flavor in the meat was phenomenal, and the steak is accompanied by potatoes and mushrooms, both very delicious sides to go along with the steak.

I would recommend this for a casual drop-in karaoke room, but I definitely would not recommend it for any sort of event for a large group that requires advance planning.  \n\nI'll start with a positive -- Karaoke rooms were spacious compared to other spots in Chinatown and we enjoyed the Chinese food. BYOB is a plus. \n\nThere were miscommunications regarding my room reservation and it seemed like a shady way to make more money rather than a simple misunderstanding. \n\nFirst of all, you can't reserve earlier than the Monday prior to the weekend you want. I called at 4:30pm on a Monday (as soon as they opened) to make a reservation for 10pm on a Friday and was confirmed for 10-1am. However, when I arrived, I was told my reservation was at 10:30pm. At that time, we were placed in a room too small for our party and did not go into the room we requested until 11:00pm. \n\nI was told on the phone that it would be $20 in cash per person for the room + food and that it is BYOB. No problem. But, at 1:30am when we went to pay our bill, we were told we were required to pay 20% gratuity on top of the bill because we were in the room longer than the 3 hour limit. Considering we did not begin karaoke or receive any food until after 11:00pm, this simply was not true. By that point, half of our party had left so the remaining 5 guests had to find a way to come up with $120(!) for gratuity.\n\nIt seems that Ken's tries to cram in walk-in reservations and makes you wait to accommodate multiple groups in a night. The system was disorganized and dishonest. If you want to have repeat customers, be clear about the price and reservation. The whole night felt shady-- with cash only and no receipts provided to verify anything.", "date": "2018-12-17 04:32:08", "user": {"name": "Linnea", "review_count": 6, "yelping_since": "2015-12-09 14:02:28", "elite": "", "average_stars": 4.17, "fans": 1}}, {"review_id": "PIbzjMj4mfU53IUiCHCf-w", "user_id": "azxj85sYQhwGGIgmlYAhSA", "business_id": "Fc_8eLlcq5yy4DzrEeqEaQ", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 6, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "text": "STAY AWAY. \n\nI am so disappointed with this experience. We were told by a friend that this restaurant offered a special deal per person for karaoke and for \"unlimited\" food.

Stuck in a small space with a large group, dirty room, we waited patiently for our reservation.  \n\nThe food was nothing special, and again, the amenities were horrendous.  We were unable to use the toilet due to it being clogged and disgusting. Even though we told a staff member, nothing was done. \n\nUpon leaving and paying what we thought we were originally told was our due amount per our agreement with the establishment, we were chased out of the restaurant by the owner who demanded an additional $120. Unbelievable. My friends and I always tip for a restaurant, but being yelled at by the owner to tip $120 on the sidewalk outside the establishment is beyond me. \n\nUpon all of this, the bill had no charges and only accepted cash. I would love to see how this business reports their profits, as it is obvious they take advantage of their customers. Without any contract or policy, they are lucky we gave them any type of extra cash.\n\nNeedless to say, I will never return.

I personally had the friscos melt and while I already love an impossible patty and sourdough I was impressed at how similar the cheese was to real American and the flavor profile overall. I had no idea I was eating a plant based anything! I also tried the Mac n cheese, while that didn't have the cheesy flavor I expected, it was delicious creamy pasta with a smoky kick from the topping seasoning. Very filing and definitely didn't leave me feeling like I missed meat. My co worker had the Buffalo chicken wrap and enjoyed that as well. We ordered the whopper pie and brookeo (an Oreo/brownie/cookie) to have later in the day and we aren't even fully combined those were vegan... SO GOOD! This definitely made me a believer in the taste possibilities for vegan food and was a good healthy alternative to a regular meat/cheese meal. I look forward to trying more of their menu.

I live 40 minutes away and saved it for this morning covered in green pepper Etc it's like she just added spinach and tomato to the order. I went over it with her numerous times and explained I was allergic. Severely disappointed and threw away $12 because I can't eat this now. \n\nI posted this on Facebook and the person who manages their socials replied claiming my food had been replaced. A bold face lie. Since I did not go to eat this until the next morning and got this order to go, and I also posted a picture of this in my living room on a TV tray with my carpet. If this is how this company handles complaints about something when someone has an allergy this is a horrible company. Had I not noticed the green pepper and started tearing apart the omelette I wouldn't have noticed the onion and then could have been in the hospital. Allergies are no joke. I will never attend any of their establishments again because if you as a company desires to lie when a customer complains because you could have hospitalized them, then clearly you care more about your reputation then doing what is right. You care more about your restaurant then peoples lives. When I worked in the service industry and people mentioned they had an allergy we took that seriously. I would have just left this on Facebook but after the lie I felt the need to post elsewhere. If you have food allergies this establishment is not", "date": "2020-07-19 12:31:21", "user": {"name": "Crystal", "review_count": 6, "yelping_since": "2013-08-27 18:06:11", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.33, "fans": 0}}, {"review_id": "-S8jweUIFYkON256-zIWgg", "user_id": "bdPYUjFbJsmGIR4vHVulQQ", "business_id": "Ipt9ga67vVC_2ob3YmVwNA", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "We really like the food but we have been there twice since the reopening and many employees were walking around with their mask pulled down below their nose, while taking orders AND carrying food.

This location is very similar to Lincoln Square's other local spots; busy atmosphere, friendly staff who know how to flip a table quickly, and a great menu that creatively tweaks the traditional stereotypical breakfast dishes.  Lincoln Square recently redesigned its menu to a large 2-sided sheet (versus the multi-sheet book they used to heave at you).  Menu favorites are still there, like Martin's Breakfast Bowl (eggs & chorizo over jalapeno corncakes) and the West Coast omelet (bacon, avocado, feta, tomato and onion). They still don't charge for egg white upgrades on omelets; score! My newest favorite dish is \"The Alex\" skillet; it has all the meats (sausage, bacon & ham) with a spicy Mexican twist (avocado, queso & pico), all drizzled with this delicious smoky chipotle Spanish sauce. The creamy chipotle drizzle is to die for and it ties all the flavors together well.  I definitely recommend this Lincoln Square location just as strongly as the other ones.

Water glasses weren't filled regularly, we were missing silverware, dinner specials weren't presented and our waitress was generally MIA. \n\nApps were fair - calamari was good; truffle fries were soggy.  Salads were dry and served on warm plates.\n\nThe gap between salads and entrees being served was at least 20 minutes and we were left waiting with empty drink glasses.  When our dinners arrived there were mixed reviews. One filet was cold and dried out and was sent back. The other entrees arrived luke warm and were served on cold plates.  No one else bothered sending their entrees back, but we all should have. Dessert was fair - nothing exceptional.\n\nWhat was most disappointing was that 20% service was included for a group of 6. Our service was really bad and we were all left wondering if it was a result of our waitress's automatic tip.  When you're paying $400+ for dinner, you should have the option to leave less gratuity, especially when the food and service were poor.

Definitely will be back to try out some more of the bao and jian bing selections as well as some of the char siu.\n\nThe pan fried dumplings had a nice hard crust on one side and a doughy exterior to the other side.  Exactly what you look for in an authentic fried dumpling.  The pork filling was excellent...rich and savory and was such a nice bite.  \n\nThe Crabmeat and Crawfish Bao was clearly one of their offerings honoring the area while still staying true to their own history.  This was a very good dumpling and had I not tasted anything else here, it would have been good enough for me to come back again.  With that said, it was my least favorite item we ordered.\n\nThe Xiao Long Bao was incredible.  This flavor rivaled the ones i've gotten in NYC and were for sure a true testament to Shanghainese cuisine.  The broth inside was extremely flavorful and the meat was so tender and moist.  I could have eaten 3 orders of these myself, and I may someday.  Don't judge me.\n\nThe Jian Bing was exactly what I hoped it would be.  Basically similar to a very thin omelet or a crepe, this was stuffed with chicken and chinese vegetables and it was fantastic.  We had a plan to Shanghai that got cancelled (thanks covid) but I watched so many videos of people grabbing these from street food vendors and I had such a longing to try it.

You'll be served with homemade chips that are light to the touch, and mild salsa. Only one choice of salsa here, not several. No cervezas (beer) or other alchohol here, which is kind of a bummer.\n\nI ordered the Vallarta Special, which is an assortment of shrimp, fish, & rice.

To be completely honest, I was delightfully stunned with the excessive amount of bacon I was served! But, first, our server was confused about which plate was mine & which was my friend's when bringing out our food - the only difference was how our eggs were cooked. And still, my friend had to send her plate back because neither pair of eggs were medium well (both of ours had been cooked over-easy). Then her replacement eggs were still not correctly cooked but our server was incredibly indifferent & dismissive, so my friend ate around the uncooked yolks. \n\nTo top off the lackluster service, we were charged a mandatory gratuity of $2.50 apiece... which our server did not earn nor appreciate.

The only other option offered was to have dinner in the lounge which was full and extremely loud due to live music. We finally got the manager involved and he found a table outside on the patio and set up a heater to keep off the chill. We order our food. The soup ( lobster bisque) tasted fantastic unfortunately neither of us got even a pea sized piece of lobster. I am willing to forget this because it is hotel dinner not 5 star. Once the food comes, the waitress who hasn't been back since dropping off the soups was smart enough to bring drink\nRefills. We got one turkey and one salmon. The turkey was okay some pieces were rubbery but it had a tasty gravy. The mashed potatoes were dried out but with some added butter they were decent.

I look down and see something on the side of my glass. On further inspection, I realize it is dried food stuck to the inside of my glass. And it has friends!!! A smear of food dried all the way down the glass and another clump around the bottom the size of a Lima bean. Not a little speck but a significant piece of food stuck on the inside of my glass. After waiting 5 minutes to get the waitress back over, she tries to tell me it is a lemon seed. When I put the glass in front of her face, she said \"eww that is gross\" \"sorry about that, do want another drink\".  Yes, oh course I want another drink. I am trying not to think about how the food got in the glass so I don't throw up the mediocre dinner I am paying $85. She did bring another drink in a clean glass. No further apology or acknowledgment of the incident. I expected at least an apology from the manager. We had to\nPut in our dessert order three times because the waiter forgot the order and we asked for coffee. It was good coffee but the carafe was filthy on the outside. Coffee stains and crud in the cracks on the outside of the carafe. Even greasy spoon dinners wipe down to carafes before serving you coffee. Overall, it was more like truck stop  service than elegant hotel service. The food was just mediocre. I wouldn't come back at $40 per person.

This time we went in for drink late evening after playing tennis at the spa.

It seemed to take forever for the waitress (our receipt says \"15 Madeline\") to get back to us. When I ordered the drink, I feel I made it very clear that we would be ordering \"just the margarita\". The waitress seemed disappointed and then said something like, \"No entree?\" (even though I feel my order was VERY clear) in what I felt was a condescending, passive-aggressive manner. (It did NOT seem like she was just trying to make sure she had the order correct.) I don't recall seeing her again for the rest of our dining. When my wife and I were finished, we waited and waited for the check. I had to ask someone else working in the restaurant to get the waitress to bring our check. When she finally brought the check, she (in a manner I felt was incredibly snide) asked my wife, \"Did you get enough to eat?\" It seemed like she was trying to be as insulting as possible without being so obvious as to get immediately fired.

They also had various other cookies in bags for $7 for 6 cookies.  The various flavours were chocolate and mint, peanut butter, and chocolate chip.

And of course, would it be Idaho without Idaho Wilderness, a huckleberry flavor? \n\nThe only ice cream here that has ever disappointed me is \"After School Special\" - the peanut butter flavor isn't that strong and the no bake cookies in it taste a bit strange.\n\nThe waffles cones are delicious and everyone working here usually seems to be in good spirits so it's got a great vibe all around.", "date": "2021-07-29 21:46:23", "user": {"name": "Alana", "review_count": 103, "yelping_since": "2011-06-12 19:14:03", "elite": "2021", "average_stars": 4.03, "fans": 1}}, {"review_id": "4yHU8f-lVTKuII7lSMN8Jw", "user_id": "5-nHKqLMvXYuBRiLOwoZNQ", "business_id": "oQdGhdjzz_HhTaC4VrtBLQ", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I loved the fun variety of flavors and the staff is always helpful.
