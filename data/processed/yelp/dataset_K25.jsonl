And I don't feel there's a massive variety in philly. I've been to parc and it's cool. But I wanted something more homey less touristy and most important : SERVES BOEUF BOURGUIGNON!!!!!! as far as I know only two places meet this massively important criteria. Parc and bistrot la minette. It was our 4 year anniversary and I chose this place. Obviously. Because anyone who knows good food and culture knows boeuf Bourguignon is the top tier of all dishes. Duh. Anyway so we get here and it's a 13 min walk in my adorable queen village neighborhood which is just amazing. I love this area of philly I think it's the best in the city. And I am blown away by the interior design and how cute and French it is. So cozy and unique. Literally everything I've ever dreamed of. We started with escargot and they were very very good. Literally loved. Loved that we got bread too. I mean can it get any better than that? My boyfriend got Lapin r\u00f4ti \u00e0 la moutarde (mustard braised rabbit with tagliatelle and rabbit jus) and I of course got boeuf Bourguignon. It was so freaking good. I do wish it was served on mashed potato's but that's not the point. The beef was perfect. And the sauce was exactly what I wanted. And my boyfriend was also blown away by his dish. We are huge rabbit fans. Always top notch at a French restaurant. To die for. So delicious. Oh and I forgot to mention the cheese puffs they randomly gave us were also absolute fire. Lol. I can't wait to come back. It's close to home which is dangerous for me. Way better than parc it's just far more unique and cute very antique and botiquey and not a big tourtist spot /cliche.

I took myself out to eat... I went to Bistrot La Minette at 623 s. 6th st. , near Bainbridge. I have been eating at the Bistro for over ten years... I found it one night while riding my motorcycle.(How I find a lot of Restaurants) Founder and Proprietor, Peter Woolsey \",as an adolescent, started cooking breakfast foods and pasta sauces by his father's side. On a whim he decided to attend Johnson and Wales for the culinary arts and immediately fell in love with cooking as a profession. In the late 90's he began his professional career cooking at the Sun Valley Resort and New York's Waldorf=Astoria. In 2000 he moved to France to study pastry at Le Cordon Bleu. In Paris, Peter worked for the world famous three-star Michelin restaurant, Lucas Carton, under Alain Senderens and Frederic Robert. In 2002 he moved back to Philadelphia working at George Perrier's Le Mas Perrier and the Striped Bass under Alfred Portale and Chris Lee. In 2004 he married French native Peggy Baud-Woolsey. In 2008 he opened Bistrot La Minette only five months after the birth of his son Jules. In 2014 Peter opened La Peg, an American brasserie, at the FringeArts Theater and in 2019 he opened Gabi, a French caf\u00e9, on North Broad with Bistrot La Minette alumnus Kenneth Bush and Brad Histand.\"  Since the bar was closed for seating I was seated at a high top table in the front of the restaurant looking out the window and by the bar. I met by server/bartender, Chris and ordered a Vodka and Tonic with Lime in a rocks glass.. A bucket of baguette accompanied my drink with several slices of baguette and a crock of butter that was sprinkled with Sea Salt, I ate the bread as I viewed the menu and listened to the specials. I already knew I was ordering the escargot !  I get it every time I'm here. The Burgundy snails are served in thimble like cups with garlic and Herb Butter and topped with a crouton... Chris recommended a Cotes du Rhone to compliment the coarse...Magnificent ! I then had a special of the day, a charcuterie plate consisting of several baguette slices, sausage slices, cornichons, mustard and a duck parfait made with emulsified duck liver and dark meat. It was covered in a wine gelee'. I used a butter knife to spread the duck on a baguette and enjoyed it with a glass of Beaujolais that Chris recommended ...  It was soooo good ! My main course was also a special of the day... Wild Boar with Carrots, Potatoes and lardon...Lardon are cubes of bacon that in this case were braised perfectly, providing the perfect amount of char to enhance the flavors !  It was all in a red wine sauce that absorbed the flavors of the meats yet still provided a nice contrast to the flavors !  A glass of Bordeaux accompanied my Boar and was perfect... Chris really hooked me up !At the end of my meal a plate was served to me with a lit candle and Birthday message written in fine chocolate... It was an Amazing night !", "date": "2021-10-29 20:57:09", "user": {"name": "Thomas", "review_count": 38, "yelping_since": "2017-12-02 02:19:55", "elite": "2021", "average_stars": 4.89, "fans": 1}}, {"review_id": "iMphMPWqo6gOxo3ToFzlgw", "user_id": "et7Ndr07Kz-4wX8bbmQjWg", "business_id": "4_-IcMpkF_sBRHomWZHNzA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "A new Philly favorite!

The Escargot was essentially a classic escargot dish in small bowls served with croutons.\n\nFor the main course, I had the Confit de canard (Duck confit) and the Poulet a la Provencale (White wine braised chicken).

It's like warm potato hash inside a giant has brown. The raw oysters were also very small - the last time I had raw oysters was in Boston, so maybe I just had too high of an expectation?

The bartender was clearly in the weeds, yet proficient regardless.  Still, there wasn't one word or gesture on his part to make us feel welcome or happy we were sitting at his bar.

No one offered to take our coats, and they were awkward to hang over the back of the chairs.  Our waiter was very personable but amateurish.

We ordered a ribeye special, medium rare, our generally preferred temperature.  It came out nearly raw and very chewy/sinewy.

Marbleized tapestries filled the voids. the low lighting took a few seconds for me to adjust to...

For my first course, I had, Crab Cake Lemon Aioli and Fennel Slaw. When the Crab cake arrived it was served atop a white sauce next to a fennel Cole slaw. I no longer had the menu, so I asked Willie what the sauce was... He told me it was from the slaw... I knew that wasn't right, but I didn't want to dispute him... I later found out it was a Lemon Aioli. It complimented the crab cake well, as did the fresh parsley... The crab cake was predominantly crab... The way I like ! The slaw was house made and fresh. For my second course I had an 8 oz. Filet served medium rare, and a glass of Pinot Nior. The filet was thick and cooked just the way I ordered. It was tender and flavorful and cut like butter ! A bit of arugula and olive oil was on the side, The wine was PERFECT ! For a vegetable, i ordered Creamed Spinach which came in its own small bowl.

Rittenhouse square a number of times for Brunch and enjoyed it very much ! The staff was ALWAYS wonderful and accommodating, and the food was always top notch ! Acclaimed James Beard Award-winning Chef Jean-Marie Lacroix honed his craft for two decades as the executive chef of the Four Season's Fountain. He then established his namesake restaurant, Lacroix at the Rittenhouse..   I saw that they had a page on Facebook, so naturally I liked their page... I began receiving notifications from them and viewed pictures of their beautifully presented food ... I HAD to go there for dinner ! I found a single seat at the bar and met my server, Amy...   For my first course I chose one of the Specials,  Cantaloupe Soup with Honeydew and Celery... \"That's something different,\" I thought, and I ordered it ! Amy recommended  a flute of Castellar Brut Cava, a Spanish sparkling wine that was very much like Champagne. The soup was served cold, and it WAS different...The broth was all Cantaloupe complimented with the earthy taste of the celery. There were slices of sweet honeydew in it that tied the whole dish together... My taste buds were confused at first, and it wasn't until I was finished with it that I realized I liked it ... I REALLY liked it !  The wine was PERFECT ! For the Main Course I ordered, Alaskan Halibut, Buerre Cancalaise, Caviar, Watercress. The Halibut was beautifully presented on a Buerre Cancalaise. a tasty sauce made of root vegetables. Caviar was in the sauce and was easily detected in my mouth. It was as beautiful as it was tasty ! The halibut was perfectly cooked and flaked apart into the  Buerre Cancalaise. The flavors were amazing together !  A side of watercress accompanied it...

Will not plan on returning.\n\nSetting: Birthday lunch taking my parents out to a nice meal as an appreciation for helping me become the person I am today.\n\nAmbience: Beautiful interior with lovely classical music playing at a comfortable decibel.\n\nService: Unfortunately, this is what distracted terribly from otherwise okay dining. We were seated at our table for reservation without delay. The water servers began the lunch great attention. Our server Jorge disappointed in his recommendations for our meal. I asked which items off the lunch menu were most recommended and why. He pointed out the Blue crab toast and Fois Grae, as well as the Lobster and Halibut dishes without much explanation of their flavor profile or their selling points. \n\nMy mother inquired whether the restaurant was still doing any sort of gift dessert for a birthday celebration and he stated no, but if we ordered a dessert and we reminded him that it was my birthday, he could request the chef write out happy birthday on the plate.\n\nOnto the entrees:\nWhen our food finally came, he placed the dishes in the center of the table, as he knew we were sharing. However, he did not give us any small plates for service. It took 3 minutes before we hailed him back for the plates. He stated, he apologized given that he thought someone else would do this. I then immediately requested he take a picture for the table. He said to wait one moment and then he left our table.\n\nI watched as he serviced multiple tables and he never returned back to our table. He poured another table some wine, he took orders from a table adjacent. While my parents and I waited for the picture before starting to eat, our food started to become lukewarm and he started to help ourselves.  \n\nWe finished our food, unfortunately disappointed by the temperature, the portion size, pricing and abandonment of service. \n\nAfter we finished eating, the waiter finally came back 15 minutes later asking, Oh right, you wanted a picture? At this point, our mood had already been tainted.\n\nA supervisor Jennifer Noble fortunately came by the table and profusely apologized; but the damage was done. She gave our table several small dessert bite sizes to nibble on. The sour taste of the meal could not wash away the prior hour.\n\nFood:\nFoie Gras - it was a thin layer of the liver sandwiched between an herbacious bread and slice of mango. These triplicate layers were repeated three times on top of each other in a stack. The bread layer definitely overpowered all other flavors. The mango was bland. The liver was virtually unnoticeable.\n\nLobster (3/5) - there was a beautiful lobster in appearance, but in taste, it was relatively bland. \n\nHalibut (3/5) - the fish was prepared over a nice white sauce and small little grapes and mushrooms adorning the dish. The grapes introduced a sour but bright contrast to the halibut, which I felt could have used some additional seasoning.\n\nSteak (4/5_ - these were tiny slices with two pieces of asparagus, it was cooked well, the meat was tender and balanced in saucework.\n\nTips/Takeaways:\nAlthough the food may taste okay, this was a birthday meal to remember for all the wrong reasons. \nFrom the lack of service checking on our table in between placing the entree dishes out to grabbing the check, from the lackluster explanations of dishes, from the inability to honor a simple picture request, from the smaller portion sizes and bland tastes, this ultimately was a meal that was not worth the heavy price tag.\nIt pains my heart to have to rate this experience so lowly.", "date": "2021-07-18 21:33:24", "user": {"name": "Victor", "review_count": 218, "yelping_since": "2018-07-14 20:47:36", "elite": "2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 3.83, "fans": 23}}, {"review_id": "Rxs7485BG9aX054xHXy0hw", "user_id": "1uXI4Z7wftN7NticiG4feA", "business_id": "e3Y3hDpwHc9RmQlJtIgHuw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Always an A+ experience.

My friend did nothing to that waiter, so I don't understand why it happened twice in a row. The waiter was also incredibly rude to one of my friends who has celiac disease (gluten allergy). When she asked if there were gluten free options the waiter seemed baffled, questioning the validity of her allergy, stating he had no idea which dishes could accommodate her allergy!! Furthermore, the waiters were quite slow and messy in their service. There were long stretches of time where we felt unattended. When they did some they were constantly spilling the liquids all over the table. In one instance, they spilled some champagne on a hand made card I gave to my friend. In another instance, water was spilled all over our plate. In both these cases, there was no attempt made to acknowledge the incident nor apologize. Even worse, we noticed some of the hosts going to grab coats for guests from coat check. We saw a host have the audacity to put on one of the coats and act as though he's walking a runway!!

The lacroix restaurant presents itself very nicely and is definitely one of the fancier places here in Philly.\n\nI have dined here a few times and would have to say, it is one of the more unique experiences. The food is delicious and the staff are one of the best. \n\nThe first time I came here was on easter morning for a nice bunch with my grandparents and girlfriend. We were blown away by the presentation and staff right off the bat. The wait staff tended to our every need and gave us a tour of the food presentation areas. \n\nThis is an all you can eat brunch, so there were many foods beautifully presented, along with nice decorations. Each station is very easy to access and use. \n\nThe more unique part of this dining experience was the entry and food located in the kitchen area. While cooks are making the food, you can walk around and take food off of the stations. There are also manned stations  in which you can ask for specific things such as a cut of meat or a freshly made ice cream made with liquid nitrogen. \n\nEach station is clearly laid out and the waiters will assist in giving you a tour and helping choose tasty foods. Many of the foods here are fancier such as the caviar and the tasty s'mores foie gras. \n\nFor specific stations, there is a meat station, where you can get tasty, freshly cut in front of you, steaks and things such as Wagyu. There is a dessert station, which hosts a plethora of tasty desserts, a chocolate fountain, and a person that makes ice cream for you. (Also in front of you) There is a breakfast station, that has many of the basic breakfast foods: eggs, potatoes, bacon, etc.  there is also a raw bar with many oysters, shrimp, and other delicious options. There are many more stations as well. \n\nThe dress code here is more upscale and nicer, so you should try to wear something a little nicer. I have seen individuals wear jeans and a tee shirt, bu t this sort of makes the place awkward since everyone else is dressed up. \n\nFor drinks, there is a full bar with many options. You can order whatever you want, and it will come back perfect. They try to make it a really great experience, so your happiness is taken into account. \n\nI would also like to address the more classy, spoiled, and rich people. My first encounter with a waiter involved many sirs and pardons, so if you are a fancy snob, you will be treated as a king/queen. At the time, I found this funny because of the fact that I am very used to talking to waiters and waitresses casually. This waiter made me feel special. Very cool!\n\nThe amount of tasty food you can eat is massive, and you will be amazed at how full you can get. If you want to have a great experience, I would say try everything and if you are still hungry, take the things you enjoyed the most. \n\nThe bathrooms are also very nice and upscale. I was surprised to find complimentary bottles of mouth wash in the men's room and complimentary sewing kits and other things in the women's (found by girlfriend) \n\nGetting reservations for here is a little tricky, as it is usually booked and very upscale. A person needs to pull some  strings to get here, but it is well worth it. \n\nOverall, this place was very unique and impressive. I recommend going here, and if you want to be even more impressed, go during a holiday/ special occasions. A really great place to go and even better food pics!\n\nViews are awesome too so get a window seat!", "date": "2019-03-25 23:52:49", "user": {"name": "Andrew", "review_count": 164, "yelping_since": "2017-06-30 02:01:00", "elite": "20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.37, "fans": 19}}], "review_count_actual": 25}

I like more texture in my potato's but their version is smooth. This is just my preference. Mac n cheese was very smooth. Again I prefer more texture--but theirs is just smooth gooey cheese. Also just my own preference. Asparagus was tender and well cooked. Very buttery as well.\n\nSteaks were high quality, and tasty. Lobster was fresh and delicious as well.\n\nDesserts were awesome. Loved the cheesecake. Loved the lava cake, which was great with the ice cream. Beautiful presentation.\n\nWaiters were very kind, professional, attentive. Bill was high but expected. You pay for the experience and I personally had no regrets.", "date": "2021-08-08 16:23:11", "user": {"name": "Lux", "review_count": 11, "yelping_since": "2015-09-06 18:58:01", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.58, "fans": 0}}], "review_count_actual": 25}

It's a beautiful high class Resteraunt. We'll laid out with a nice water view (some buildings and a shopping center) but still a nice view of a big body of water.\nThere are servers and bus boys and girls and helpers all over.\nNice table outside the main dining room but still covered and warm. Waiter (started off) helpful , friendly and attentive (that didn't last). Great menu choices and specials all high end with an appropriate cost to match. \nBread basket outstanding with soft pretzel sticks my all time favorite. French onion soup appetizer well done and Washington State oysters. First 5 really tasty the 6th, rancid and sour. Mentioned this to the waiter then one of the managers came over apologizing and offering another serving which I declined (big meal coming) so she comped these on the bill. That's great service and relations.\nDinner comes NY Strip with blue cheese and an imported filet mignon oscar and a lobster tail. All perfectly cooked, another plus.\nHere is where it falls apart, but first I digress. Wife tells me business casual. On their web site no issues, socks, shirt l, shoes and a sport coat. In the lobby people being seated with shorts, flip flops, T-shirts etc. hey everyone deserves to eat right and pay these prices.\nBack to our sever he disappeared for about 18 minutes after we had stopped eating (we had leftovers). Why you may ask? We'll he had a table of eight and was opening and pouring bottle after bottle of wine. I can imagine the bill and tip associated with that. But hey we're just 2 people with a measly $200+ bill why worry. \nFinally he stops by, can we get some containers for left overs? Sure and another 10 minutes while he's pouring more wine and hopping around. Meanwhile there are numerous bus people moving about, so we grab one can we speak to the manager from earlier. \nShe pops over we explain and she's again apologetic and tells us when you come back see her she'll make sure everything goes right. To her credit she also comped our two drinks and offered me my free birthday dessert to go which I declined.\nBottom line, great atmosphere, food and view.

Went to dinner last night with family in Tampa. The restaurant is beautiful inside and they have a few dining table options with reservation which I highly recommend even on a weeknight.  Bar tables can be reserved as well as outside dining.\nWe started at the bar for a quick happy hour because we arrived a little before our reservation. Found a bunch of seats and sat. The bartender had a bit of an attitude which rubbed us the wrong way at first but luckily he (name starts with a J and rhymes with possum) did not serve us most of our drinks. We found they had a happy hour drink and snack menu with a small but good variety. \nThe TEQUILA COCKTAIL \u00a0Corzo Silver Tequila, Fresh Squeezed Orange And Lime Juice, House Infused Agave Nectar was very sweet but nice and flavorful. They make a very good Espresso Martini even though that was not on the happy hour reduced price menu. The bar bites could easily be a good meal option and everything on the bar bite menu is $5 off during the hours of 4-6pm. \nThe  JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKE \u00a0Kale, Pickled Fennel, Horseradish Mustard Aioli\u00a0 was delicious and not much wasted filler. Lots of big pieces of crab body meat. \nThe  SPICY TUNA* \u00a0Cucumber, Scallion, Tempura Fried\u00a0\u00a0was awesome. Not much rice and a great flavor of chopped tuna on top. \nIn the dining room, we had Jake as our lead  server from his team and he was one of the best servers we have ever had. On point with recommendations and spaced our meal out perfectly so we had time to enjoy the evening. My synopsis of what we ordered. \nWe started with appetizers for the table. The SONOMA GOAT CHEESE RAVIOLI \u00a0Golden Oak Mushrooms  were tender and the pasta in the sauce make them perfectly silky. \nThe OCEAN ROLL*\u00a0gfm\u00a0\u00a0#1 Tuna, Salmon, Hamachi, Avocado, Chili Garlic Oil was so fresh and good for sharing which we did. The WHITE TRUFFLE CAVIAR DEVILED EGGS\u00a0gfm had a little drop of caviar on top and although they were not complicated, they were smooth and very good. (Like momma used to make). As if we had not ordered enough appetizers, we also added The SMOKED GOUDA TATER TOTS from the sides and were so glad we did. They were not greasy at all and a pretty big portion. It came with a mayonnaise flavored dipping sauce which was perfect. I added a little Tabasco to it and it then had the perfect added kick.\nOn to the entrees.\nI ordered the SHELLFISH \"COBB\" SALAD\u00a0gfm\u00a0Bacon, Blue\u00a0Cheese, Gourmet Dressing and I don't know what was in the dressing but it was perfect and not overpowering the shellfish. Perfect portion and I felt it was the best after all the appetizers eaten. Most of the family ordered  the 8 OZ FILET MIGNON which they claimed was just as good as Bern's prime beef with a Loaded Sea Salt Baked Potato. My son had the TERIYAKI SALMON* \u00a0Shiitake Sticky Rice, Soy Butter Sauce and I think he ate it before I was able to get a picture (it was that! good)\nJake then asked if we were celebrating anything special for our family and since it was the weekend of our son and his wife's  baby shower he was happy to bring us 2 desserts for the table. Two of their best by my accolades.\nChocolate Peanut butter Pie was OMG delicious! Creamy, silky and wonderful. Not crazy sweet but perfect. \nThe Warm Butter Cake with a big scoop of Vanilla Ice-cream on top and a maceration of berries on the plate was a great alternative if you are not a chocolate and peanut butter fan. The cake was warm and moist. Easy to cut and share. \nOverall, it was a fantastic dining evening and really look forward to my next return visit and I will definitely be requesting Jake and his team!", "date": "2021-09-24 13:12:40", "user": {"name": "Michelle", "review_count": 700, "yelping_since": "2013-10-19 13:42:10", "elite": "2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.26, "fans": 61}}, {"review_id": "0jen5jyl4bqQ0fgaDEfakQ", "user_id": "Pj8ECT58e-yhrAjXm8HALg", "business_id": "GVWcwqUD-ekCMQ0x2Ke6Ww", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I went for the first time on my birthday.

This review is not biased, pure 100%  our experience staying at Ritz Carlton Bacara Santa Barbara. \n\nRitz Carlton SB is not located in a prime area. This is a resort,  their property is isolated away from downtown so that customers can enjoy the activities that the resort provides, such as hiking by the beach, biking around the hotel area. Mind you, this hotel is not walkable to restaurants in SB, they provided their own chain restaurants to make guests enjoy and relax at the property.\n\nHere is our experience:\nLike any other experienced travellers, we booked our hotels through credit card partners using our mileage. Who pay their hotel rooms in full nowadays anyways? Most smart people pay their hotel rooms with points or mileage affiliated with credit cards company. Originally we booked for double beds. However a day before, I received an email from them that my room was changed to single bed. This is quite impossible to our situation since we have 2 adults and 2 children. So I called (many times) to our credit card company and to Ritz to make sure we would get 2 double beds instead of 1 single king bed. The number of phone calls to change the number of beds did not happen only in one call, unfortunately. I had to call them several times before our arrival. \n\nSo, arrival day, we got our 2 double beds. Perfect. Checking in was a smooth process. The receptionist was polite, explaining us everything about the resort. By the way, the resort has so many activities that you could book first through their website. And I also appreciate the concierge emailed us days before reminding us about the activities on the days we stay. (Tips: the receptionist offered us a transportation like a luggage cart to transport the guests to your villas, ACCEPT IT! Ritz carlton property is so huge that you can even get lost in the area. You can walk if you want to reach your 10k steps, though). \n\nWhen we got to our hotel, problem arise. Tv did not work. I called the receptionist, and the technician came after an hour later. They tried their best to fix tv, unfortunately the problem was much bigger than they expected. The sad part was they KNEW the tv was broken already and Ritz didn't even solve the problem. (Technician told me our previous guest also had the same problem - broken tv). So, me just being me, asking for a compensation for the broken tv. The technician was very generous giving us $100 restaurant fee.  And I took it with my grateful heart. \n\nResort wise; this property again has a lot activities that you can do with your kids, partners, etc. Hiking by the beach is the most popular activities done by my people. Biking around the area also a great thing to do. \n\nDuring check out time, there was a bit problem since I wanted to redeem the $100 certificate that the technician gave me. A bit miscommunication happened at that time, but they resolved it quickly.\n\nWould I recommend you guys to stay here? if you have $1000 extra to spare for staying a night here, sure you should. \nDon't forget to add\nParking vallet is $53 a day\nResort fee is $50 a day. (that's why maximise the property since you're charged hefty for resort fee). \n\nOther than that, yes I would stay again here.

The entrance to the hotel was super cool as you drive underneath an overhang of sorts which then opens up to a large courtyard with a giant fountain in the middle. The team of valets quickly rushed to our car and welcomed us to the property. After helping us unload the bags they walked us into the lobby where we got checked in. We were celebrating our recent engagement so the person who checked us in was nice enough to upgrade our room to an ocean view in Villa #9. The property was absolutely stunning and all the villas were surrounded by very well maintained landscape. It wasn't a long walk to our room, maybe 2-3 minutes, but they also offer guests a ride to their room in these long golf carts. Our room was fantastic and the views were insane! The layout of the room worked perfectly for us...the bathroom was a great size, there was a working fireplace, a nice sized sitting area, and the balcony overlooking the ocean was very spacious and private feeling. There's also nothing quite like hearing the waves crashing on the beach while sitting on your balcony! The room was nicely decorated and furnished although it did seem like it couldn't hurt to freshen up the room a little bit and update everything. The beds were a little firm but it didn't bother us too much. The shower had good water pressure and got very hot if you cranked it up. There were a few pools on property with the main pool and then an adults only pool near the spa building. There is also a short little trail that's right on the cliff side overlooking the ocean. The trail starts near the parking lot and goes all the way down to the beach. A word of caution if you're walking on the beach, the sand apparently has tar mixed in so be sure to check and clean your shoes real good after you get done walking on the beach. They have cleaning stuff up at the pool so it wasn't too much of a big deal, you just need to be aware of that beforehand. We also got the chance to dine at Angel Oak, one of the restaurants on property, and thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience. The atmosphere was great and their food was fantastic. They also had an impressive wine list with a lot of great varietals to choose from. The O Bar was another good place to grab cocktails. We didn't get the chance to eat there but the vibe was great and the bartenders whip up some really tasty drinks.

A week before our stay, my wife called in with the AAA number, and the agent told her \"Sorry, we can no longer honor the AAA rate, the room is now $1000/night, and because you are within the cancellation window, you can no longer cancel your stay.\" Incredulous, I called Marriott to explain the situation, and I asked them to listen to the recording of the original booking to ensure they would honor our quoted rate. They promised me they would resolve this in 3 days. Three days later, there was no word back from Marriott so I called again. This time they told me it would take 10 days to get the recording.

While the hotel is stunningly beautiful, the service was not nearly good enough to justify such an enormous price tag.\n\nOverall, you'll find much better value, service and satisfaction for your money elsewhere. We had originally planned to stay at a Kimpton property but got the Baccara as a nice surprise upgrade from our parents to make the weekend extra special. We probably would've been better off without that upgrade.\n\nA quick summary:\n1. Checking in - my mother in law had called maybe 30 minutes before we arrived to make sure everything would be smooth re names / cards on file, etc. the front desk had no record of this conversation- and couldn't find our reservation immediately after specifically going over the stay in detail. Checking in was stressful, took 30 minutes and when I said \"man, y'all are kinda effing this up,\" I was upbraided by Stan at the front desk for swearing. I guess the customer isn't always right at the Baccara.\n2. The bridal suite had major electrical issues. While my wife and her bridesmaids were getting ready, the fuse blew in the room at least 5 times. Not exactly the smooth and stress free prep experience you pay top dollar for.\n3. I'm a big football fan, and we had a number of folks coming to the suite on Sunday to watch one of the games. We had called in advance to ensure that we'd get the specific game...but they didn't. We figured out a way to stream the game, and just needed an HDMI cord to make it work. The staff told us none were available...despite there being multiple cords in use, in our room. After an hour plus minutes, the cord arrived and we missed an entire half of football.\n4. Every time we tried to charge something to the room, the hotel had a different last name on file. We ended up having to remember which service had which of our three last names at every different hotel venue. This isn't a big deal, but is indicative of the general malaise and inattention to detail we experienced throughout our stay.\n5. Every service was SLOW. We waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up our luggage. Again, this isn't a big deal but it's just not what you expect at a top tier resort charging top tier prices.", "date": "2021-10-11 19:57:46", "user": {"name": "Nick", "review_count": 6, "yelping_since": "2012-01-07 22:47:03", "elite": "", "average_stars": 1.17, "fans": 0}}, {"review_id": "wQVD4QnA6N9haZxWvzaBtw", "user_id": "gDiqeetP2iZZoD7bNEIjig", "business_id": "8A5LSwsKK5vXDH1M3_Tf1w", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "We actually moved over to the Ritz from another hotel which we were originally booked at.

I had not been able to go back until this last weekend (Labor day 2021).  Unfortunately I did not enjoy my stay and am so sad that a once great place to stay has not deteriorated so much.\n\nMy 2018 experience - No resort fees, no spa fees, no reservations needed to use the pool, while swimming in the pool multiple people brought by fresh fruit and snacks.  The pool had a small snack shack with reasonably priced food (a sausage sandwich was $8).  You could use the main pool or the oval pool in front of the cabanas for free with no reservation.  There was a happy hour in the evening in the lobby where free drinks were given out.  In the free spa there was towel and robe service, and free snacks and tea/infused water was available.  Shampoo, conditioner, and other soaps was in my room when I checked in.\n\nMy 2021 experience - I was surprised that I was being changed a 'resort fee' of $56 ($50 + $6 'resort fee tax').  But oh well, at least I could still use the steam room that I enjoyed so much last time.  However, when I got there I was told that I would need to pay another $95 to use the spa!  (plus no doubt anothe $6+ 'spa tax').  I don't know for sure because I did not go in.  So at the Ritz Carlton you have to pay fees on top of fees, then additional fees if you want more.  It wasn't like that in 2018.  I told the Ritz employees that I did not have to pay a resort fee or spa fee or taxes when I stayed in 2018, but none of them that I spoke with worked at Ritz Carlton Bacara in 2018.  I was told that the spa fee was because of 'covid'. But when I asked about it further, they told me that the spa fee started before covid started and would continue after covid ended.  So it is obvious to me that the 'covid' excuse is so Ritz can charge more money for what people used to get for free.   When I checked in my room there was no shampoo there.  The sink drain was broken and we had to call a repair person to fix it.  When we asked the repair person about the shampoo and toiletries, he was kind enough to call someone to bring them.  But why did we have to call?  Why weren't those in the room already when we got there?  They were there in 2018, as they should be.\n\nPool experience...I had to get a 'reservation' to go in.  After swimming in the large pool, I wanted to swim in the oval adjacent pool in front of the cabanas.  I was told that this pool was reserved for the exclusive use of the cabana rentals.  In 2018 I was free to use that pool and I didn't have a cabana.  No cabanas were being rented and the pool was empty at that time.  Just another excuse for the Ritz to squeeze a few bucks (by a few bucks, I mean likely hundreds of dollars) from their customers.\n\nNo doubt that customers of the Ritz Carlton are wealthy and can afford to be 'nickeled and dimed' (in this case, 'fifty and hunder dollared') but after staying a room costing $1500 for that Saturday night on a Labor day weekend does Ritz really need to squeeze every $100 it can from its customers?  I guess the answer is yes.  \n\nBefore my 2021 stay, I was constantly telling my friends how great the Ritz Carlton Bacara was, what a great experience, what a great value, etc.  I won't be saying that any more, and likely won't stay there again.  Not that the Ritz Carlton is so horrible...it isn't.  It's just way over priced for what you get, and there are better just as beautiful options available for a more reasonable price.  \n\nSo if you want a $36 breakfast burrito ($28 + $8 tax/tip) and $5 drip coffee (plus tax/tip), then the Goleta Ritz Carlton Bacara is for you.", "date": "2021-09-07 23:32:33", "user": {"name": "Patrick", "review_count": 14, "yelping_since": "2008-02-17 20:11:46", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.07, "fans": 1}}, {"review_id": "3Rs-T8pz2Mrj0db4Pf-qiw", "user_id": "yYQI7FiqcVdLGlYxKPZuwA", "business_id": "8A5LSwsKK5vXDH1M3_Tf1w", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Just getting the concierge on the phone before our stay to ask about recommendations took 3 phone calls and several days. Once I spoke to her, she said she would make us dinner reservations for Friday night but never did. And didn't follow up. \n\nWhen we arrived we had to wait roughly 20-25 minutes to check in because the line was so long and despite being a Marriott Platinum member, there was no separate line for guests with status. \n\nI was informed by the woman checking us in there were several upgrades available since I was a platinum member, but then pulled a bait-and-switch by telling me she would be happy to discount them from $800/night to only $600/night. I declined this offer and didn't appreciate the upsell attempt.\n\nThere was a nice card in my room with a stuffed lion and a ballon for my birthday, which was a nice surprise. But this is a great example of the inconsistency at the property. Terrible check in process, lack of follow-through from concierge but then does something very nice like this. \n\nRoom service the first evening for dinner and even the next day for breakfast was wonderful. We received our order correctly and very quickly. We were very happy...\n\nBut here comes the inconsistency: breakfast on Saturday was supposed to take 50 min (which is already a very long time) but it actually took 75 min and our order was incorrect. \n\nSince we were now running late for our first winery tour, we had to inhale our food and take off because we didn't have time to have the order fixed. \n\nSunday was a repeat of Saturday for breakfast...\n\nIt took longer then they initially told us, I had to call to check on it after an hour, and it was completely wrong again. And since we were checking out and now running late, we didn't have time to have it fixed. \n\nService at the pool was actually quite good and we enjoyed our time at the pool on Friday. The bartenders and wait staff were courteous, professional, friendly, and actually got our orders correct. This should be standard service especially at a Ritz, but at this property -- it's the exception not the rule. \n\nGiven it was my birthday we were celebrating, we were pretty disappointed with the service. I mentioned our frustration to the women working the desk during checkout. She wasn't a great communicator and didn't seem to care much -- my guess was because she was overwhelmed with the line of people checking in/out which was again very long. But did say she'd talk to the manager and see what they could do. \n\nWhile I wasn't satisfied with this at the time and I'm still not, they did remove about $200 worth of room service charges. This is too little too late and doesn't make up for the poor service or lack of professionalism that happened to my wife upon checkout...\n\nUpon leaving we mentioned our frustration with the room service to bell boy and he said, \"Oh yeah, everyone around here knows the food service is pretty bad.\" \n\nThat same bell boy then followed my wife to the ATM to ask her for a tip which I felt was a little forward and unprofessional, but he was not to be outdone by another bell boy -- who knocked on our car window to tell me wife actually he was the one that loaded the car and not and not the other guy. And then proceeded to ask for a tip. \n\nOverall, I've received better service at a standard Marriott property let alone a Ritz-Carlton. We stayed at The Peninsula in Chicago a few months ago while on a visit to Chicago and the level of service we received there was far above and beyond this. And ironically, the Peninsula was cheaper. \n\nI feel fortunate I used points for this stay because had I paid $1500 a night, I might have started yelling at people. But then again, maybe that's the reason for the poor service -- I'm not sure but I've seen people hint at this in reviews.", "date": "2021-09-07 00:32:41", "user": {"name": "Jackson", "review_count": 53, "yelping_since": "2012-05-15 04:47:17", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.65, "fans": 7}}, {"review_id": "aVVHTLX1jErkVYJqQ24wXQ", "user_id": "rzjvY7mtJUy7ve2QnUsRPA", "business_id": "8A5LSwsKK5vXDH1M3_Tf1w", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "Don't bother!

This upscale fine-dining restaurant is great for special occasions when you are prepared to splurge because it is definitely not cheap. I love the low light setting with low table couch seating because it enhances the intimate atmosphere. Dress code is also more semi formal than casual. Steak wise, they have a good variety of options from standard to American Wagyu to Japanese Wagyu. They know how to prepare the steak to medium rare perfection. They also have a good selection of seafood platters as well. They served the quality of the ingredients and it is definitely worth the experience.\n\n*DINNER*\n\nHamachi Crudo - 4 slices of fresh hamachi with citrus ponzu and avocado jalape\u00f1o topping. The hamachi was very fresh and decadent. The citrus ponzu, not as sour as I thought, perfectly pairs well with the light hamachi flavor.\n\nSeared Diver Scallops - the scallops was cooked to PERFECTION. The texture was so soft and tender, not chewy at all, like you're eating raw scallops but it was fully cooked. The citrus sauce was the highlight. It was sour, which I love. The broiled mushroom was also very juicy but crispy, \n\nGlatt Kosher Ribeye - perfectly medium rare. A bit too salty for my liking. Think it would go very well with some sauce but we didn't get any. Good but not my favorite.\n\nAmerican Wagyu Filet Mignon - when you think about how tender and buttery Wagyu can be, this did its jobs. Easy to cut, easy to chew with just enough saltiness. Perfectly cooked to medium rare.\n\nTruffled mashed potatoes - great mashed potatoes, pretty heavy with the truffle flavor\n\nCreamed Spinach - not as heavy as I thought, very good pairing with the saltiness of the steak. \n\nBanana pudding creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e - let's just say, this is the best creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e I've ever had. \n\n*VERDICT*\nWould definitely come back again for another special occasion", "date": "2022-01-12 16:22:16", "user": {"name": "Lucy", "review_count": 94, "yelping_since": "2017-05-31 01:01:54", "elite": "2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 3.95, "fans": 15}}, {"review_id": "zl_WlTi9YmXhTYIABTFYtQ", "user_id": "HEZSS-fFZOSXmvjd8Me2Tw", "business_id": "wbDRmtxaKRpBOjutvV6TEA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Barclay prime is the best restaurant that you can visit within the city.

Barklay Prime is the fourteenth Steven Starr Restaurant in my series so far... I arrived with my friend Robin. We were seated at a quaint table for two where we met our server, Glenn. I ordered a flute of, champagne, ployez-jacquemart, 'extra quality brut', ludes, france, as  I often like to start a meal with Champagne.  Robin was feeling a bit adventurous, and ordered a cocktail she never had before, The Metropolis, belvedere ginger zest, limoncello, thyme, white cranberry. For me, this was the beginning of an exciting evening. I enjoy sharing a meal with someone who is willing try new things ! We ordered our appetizers. Robin ordered Seared Diver Scallops, carrot, citrus, with broiled maitake mushroom, While I ordered, Oysters on the Half Shell*, half dozen, red wine mignonette. I also ordered a soup... Lobster Cappuccino.  While viewing the menu, Robin expressed an interest in, Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, aged parmesan, arugula, lemon, porcini, scallop mousseline, but never having tried it, she ordered the Scallops, \"just to be safe\"... She didn't want to order it and find out she didn't like it. I have had Carpaccio and I like it. Since we started out trying new things I wanted to continue that theme, and suggested we order The Carpaccio and split it...Much to my excitement Robin agreed... Glenn brought us a Puff Pastry like bread that was made with Guyer Cheese and called a Popover... It came with a small bowl of soft butter that was sprinkled with sea salt... It was SOOO good ! The Oysters came out first. In my excitement, I regret that I didn't take a picture of them. They were served with a red wine mignonette and horse radish and were very good !  Robin never had Oysters before and was willing to give one a try. The excitement escalated ! Although she didn't like them very much, we both agreed, it was so much fun ! Next came The Carpaccio, Robins Scallops and my soup, Lobster Cappuccino. I had another flute of Champagne and Robin had another Metropolis as she found it to be \"Very refreshing!\" The two large Scallops were served with  a sauce of, carrot, and citrus,  and with broiled maitake mushroom. They were presented beautifully. The Lobster Cappuccino was assembled tableside. Four small Scallops Porcini Mushrooms and mousseline were presented in the center of the bowl. Glenn had a small pitcher of a \"Lobster Bisque\" like soup that he poured around  the bowl circling the contents highlighting them well. It was as beautiful as It was delicious ! I tried a bit of Robins Scallops and she tried a spoon full of my soup. Once again... DELICIOUS  !  Then we shared The Carpaccio ! Robin was pleasantly surprised at how much we both enjoyed it... ANOTHER FIRST for my adventurous  friend ! For our main course. Robin decided on, Ribeye prime 40 day dry-aged, with Kennett Square Mushrooms,  House Steak Sauce  and  Whipped Potatoes. I ordered, American Wagyu, Ribeye Cap, snake river farms, Idaho. with Creamed Spinach and Small Potatoes. Both Steaks were cooked to a perfect medium rare temperature ! And both were AMAZING !!! Glenn so aptly recommended a Ripasso by Valpolicella, Italy...It was a medium bodied red wine with a complex flavor profile that was excellent with my steak. After sampling my wine, Robin decided to stick with her Metropolis which by this point was quickly becoming her \"favorite drink.\" Naturally We tried each others' steak and while they were both EXCELLENT we both agreed that The Wagyu was the better tasting of the two... Now was time for desert !  We shared a slice of Lemon Cheese Cake that was sprinkled with small chunks of Dark Chocolate and crowned with a crispy vanilla wafer. We each enjoyed a cup of Cappuccino with our desert. I had a Sambuca with mine... I even managed to talk Robin into trying  Sambuca with her Coffee... One taste was enough for her and she enjoyed the rest of her cappuccino by itself... lol ! Again I regret that I did not take pictures... We had a BLAST ! It was SO MUCH FUN ! Everything was PERFECT ! In fact Robin said it may have been the \"best meal she ever had !\" It was made so with the expert help of Glenn, who was the perfect gentleman and most proficient server ! I had a wonderful time with wonderful people and wonderful food, and will not soon forget the evening or the meal...  https://barclayprime.com/.", "date": "2021-10-29 21:47:53", "user": {"name": "Thomas", "review_count": 38, "yelping_since": "2017-12-02 02:19:55", "elite": "2021", "average_stars": 4.89, "fans": 1}}, {"review_id": "KV4ELdP4E7x5q_lfHcJ3NQ", "user_id": "Bs9hv0zgdY8khKwTCmrNoQ", "business_id": "wbDRmtxaKRpBOjutvV6TEA", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "Opulence is a word that comes to mind.

It's a pricey place, much more expensive than the restaurants I normally frequent, so I held off for a very special occasion. Well, that time came this year and I'm happy to say that it was a wonderful dinner. \n\nAmbiance: Relaxing and tastefully decorated. Like a modern, somewhat minimalist, library. The lighting was dim and perfect, the chairs were comfy armchairs. It was a comfortable setup for the hefty meal we were about to have. \n\nFood: Honestly, I eat steaks infrequently, so I kept my order basic. I got a bone-in New York strip cooked medium-rare. It was cooked perfectly and super delicious. My wife got a ribeye cooked medium, same results for her. We loved our steaks. We got three sides: creamed spinach, mac and cheese, and tater tots. All were delicious, but the tater tots, being so random on the menu, were such a standout... like deep fried cylinders of mashed potatoes. We also got the skillet cookie dessert, which was fantastic. Highly recommended if you want something sweet, the cookie is sectioned into chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and sugar, all were excellent. \n\nDrinks: The drinks were great, but they're extremely pricey. As delicious as they were, $17 for a cocktail is wild. I knew what I was getting into, so I don't think it's be fair to take off a star for this, but the price is ridiculous. And that's not even touching their $30 signature cocktails...\n\nService: Great. Our server was kind and accommodating. He answered all of our questions nicely and his suggestions were great. My only note is that he could have come by our table a little more, but I know restaurants are having staffing issues these days and the place was pretty busy for a Tuesday night, so it's all good. \n\nOverall: We loved our dinner at Barclay Prime and would absolutely go again. It's a pricey meal, 2 steaks, 3 sides, 2 drinks, a dessert and tip came out to a bit under $300 for two people, but it was worth it for delicious food on a special night.", "date": "2021-09-20 01:24:54", "user": {"name": "Greg", "review_count": 97, "yelping_since": "2011-10-18 01:24:43", "elite": "2015,2016,2021", "average_stars": 4.13, "fans": 3}}, {"review_id": "2lVsvlYheTBxS6cAuho35g", "user_id": "wQoe1WDVAYiYe0NoyLNDtw", "business_id": "wbDRmtxaKRpBOjutvV6TEA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Amazing meal - the best I've ever had.

I'm a Stephen Starr fangirl, and I was determined to take him to the best of the Philadelphia restaurants in his empire, and I really couldn't have chosen better than this. \n\nAt the time that I made the reservation, only bar seating was available. I was initially disappointed because I didn't want to sit at the bar to eat dinner, but where we were actually seated was in a pretty lounge area in the front room, with plush seating and lovely lighting provided by candles and shaded wall lamps. Our server was extremely friendly and informative, going above and beyond in service quality (more on that in a bit)! We started with glasses of water, the Clover Days cocktail for my brother, and a delectable basket of popovers, which were flaky, light, rich and delicious all at once, and came with a whipped salted butter, though the popovers were so good on their own they didn't even need the butter.\n\nI'm a vegetarian, so I decided to go with the Caesar salad (I make an occasional pescatarian allowance), and an order of tater tots. My brother loves a good steak, but he never treats himself out to a steakhouse. So like the bossy older sister that I am, I told him, get whatever you want! And so he got the American Wagyu NY strip steak, and an order of truffle whipped potatoes. He's not as effusive as me, but he finished every bite of his meal with enthusiasm, and declared it one of the best steaks he'd ever had. He insisted that I try his whipped potatoes, and while they were very flavorful, the super-smooth creamy texture isn't for me. The tater tots, on the other hand, were incredible. The waiter thought I was nuts when I told him I've never actually had tater tots before. Pretty sure if I ever have them again, nowhere else will they have such a shatteringly crisp and deliciously salty exterior, with a perfectly cloud-like mashed potato interior. I confess I had to take most of the tasty little bites home because the Caesar salad was huge, and the dressing and grated cheese so good that I shamelessly mopped up the dish with the last of my popover. \n\nNow, getting back to the above and beyond service by our waiter - the steak and salad were brought out by a another member of the serving staff, (sooner than I expected), but no whipped potatoes or tots in sight. When our main server returned to check on us moments later, he exclaimed over the absence of our side orders, (turns out they were sent to another table) and remedied the oversight within minutes, all the while apologizing for the mixup. It was barely a delay at all, so my brother and I hardly minded, but he insisted on removing both items from our bill, effectively making them on the house. Maybe it's because I'm not used to restaurants with such stellar service, or maybe because I'm more used to having to point out missing food to the server myself, and getting an annoyed reaction, with the missing items eventually being brought out later. \n\nYes, Barclay Prime is quite expensive, but it's worth every penny, from the amazing service, to the beautiful decor, to the insanely delicious food. For a special occasion or if you want to super-treat someone (or yourself), this is definitely one of the top options in Philadelphia.", "date": "2021-09-06 21:07:15", "user": {"name": "Alexandra", "review_count": 286, "yelping_since": "2008-02-27 22:39:48", "elite": "2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 3.99, "fans": 103}}, {"review_id": "sIH_XohARh2ljvVgDSL5zw", "user_id": "86Sy0lj1Cxdv3MjT0NSfmQ", "business_id": "wbDRmtxaKRpBOjutvV6TEA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "Simply put, Barclay Prime is the gold standard for steak houses in Philadelphia.

The wagy melts in your mouth. so soft that you will feel a different ecstacy, the scallops are humungous  served with delicious sauce.\n\nBefore they served you the Entre\u00e9, they will serve a sorb\u00e9t ( depending on the flavor they have) my favorites are lemon, mango and watermelon added with Chamagne.. It's a delight to clean your palate, the servers are happy to serve us one more round.\n\nFor our entre\u00e9, I have been three times pardon me if I don't remember it.

The risotto salmon was creamy and light. The noodle in the menu with bunch of seafood was our favorite, pasta was fresh and tasty, adding with seafood was sumptuous.. \n\n\nIf you want to order a ceasar salad they will prepare in front on you, I got to experience the freshness.  I ordered a lemon drop lavander martini, your server will prepare in front of you, the sourness is that excites me..\n\nThey'll give you a hot towel to clean your hands\n\nTheir dessert was good, I recommend the cheesecake and the chocolate. But if not they will give you a chocolate caramel at the end of the meal.\n\nI got to experience to meet the chef that all do the wonders and magic in our food. He gives so much love on his plate masterpieces. I commend Chef Kirk Zion Miranda, he is humble and graciuosly gives us his small amount of time..\n\nEveryone, the staff are warm and welcoming.

I have heard good things about Bimini and made the reservation.  \n   I am not a snob nor a professional critic but when I am paying 50 to 75 dollars for a steak or lamb I expect it to be without flaw.  All four of us, MEH, mediocre cuts of meat, small cuts and just plain bland.  Could have gotten the same quality and cut for one third the price across the street.  10 to 15 dollars for the sides, bland, nothing special and really small potions, shareable, not.  Oysters Rockefeller for an appetizer, dry and tasted \"old\".  Finally, we all shared the table side prepared Bananas Foster for dessert.  Which brings me to the service.  Two gents shared duties and neither of them had one personality between them.  Overworked, running around, no care, no love, no passion for fine dinning service.  I felt as if I was at Moes diner at rush hour.  Terrible service experience.  Either they were both pissed off, didn't care or were poorly trained.  All in all for a $400.00 bill the food was sub-standard, the service was weak and the general atmosphere left me angry and dying to leave the Bimini and the Peppermill.  \n   At this price point, I will not except the now stock excuse of - we can't get anyone to work-, not when one pays this kind of money and gets a one to two star experience.  Nobody is asking for their butt to be kissed, but check on your table, a thank you, engage in conversation when you are making a table side dessert.

Our first getaway since the pandemic.  Didn't want to travel too far so took the drive from the Bay Area for 5 night stay in one of the luxury suites.  Got in yesterday and was really looking forward to dinner here.  First off it took about 10 minutes after we were seated for someone to come take our drink order.  Hubby has a shellfish allergy so couldn't really order any appetizers.  But we did order the bone marrow.  It was basically tasteless.  Only finished half of one bone.  Our Waiter wasn't aware that there were two different 22 oz bone-in ribeyes on the menu.  I had to get the menu back and show him.  I asked for mine to be cooked between medium & medium well (Ruth Chris calls it medium plus).  The waiter had a hard time with it...  It ended up coming out more like medium rare.  No pink at all it was pure red.  They took it back to cook it more and what a disaster.  It was overlooked.  All brown.  More like well done.  Very dry and no seasoning whatsoever.  I only ate a few bites.  My scalloped potatoes were dry and not good.  After we were done our waiter came by and said he would bring our check.  Did not even ask us if we wanted dessert.  That is a first.  Never ever would I visit this place again.

But each time the dishes were taken away and a new dish brought out, our silverware would be taken away but new ones did not replace them -- this happened a few times.\n\nThe biggest offense in service though, was that on the tasting menu there is no mark up noted on the MP fish of the day, nor the lamb special she had explained to us when we ordered/ ask about it. I specifically asked what the fish of the day was , and she replied and explained but did not say there'd be an upcharge of $10 or that there would be an upcharge of $5 to my friend's lamb dish..\n\nOnce we got the bill , after already setting the check on the table she said \" oh god you guys are going to hate me, but I have to add the $5 on top and the $10 for the fish\"... what up charge? She didn't tell us. The usual route and the best customer service is to note it for next time, let us know that \"  hey by the way there was a $5 and  $10 I forgot to tell you guys about, but since I the server forgot to tell you, we'll waive the charge\". Instead of \" hey i forgot to tell you guys about this $15 up charge soooo I'm just going to add it to your bill... \"   (since 20% gratuity is included anyway and she knows we cant deduct that). \n\nOverall I was pretty displeased with the way she handled that and found it completely manipulative and unprofessional.\n\nFood was good but the service left a unpleasant taste in my mouth.", "date": "2017-06-18 16:30:24", "user": {"name": "Tiffany", "review_count": 655, "yelping_since": "2011-03-23 20:49:36", "elite": "2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 3.55, "fans": 58}}, {"review_id": "N3Yb9qjG5hbN9xDfIQMwgw", "user_id": "Y985t6sOofcBRPqeU0VRgA", "business_id": "RleiW2_QLyxgNjFfqDoZpw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "First time  here with my husband to celebrate my 40th birthday .

You can occasionally go wrong with a crab cake, but this was fantastic, not at all bready or heavy, and very creamy.\n\nPasta - Every pasta we got was great, but the ditalini and agnolotti were amazing.

The meat was extremely tender, and it was so rich that we couldn't even finish it despite it being a smaller portion of food. That may have been due to the other courses we had before it, though.\n\nService was great. For as crowded and busy a small venue it was, our server explained everything in detail and was so kind.

Scallop and pork belly was great, mussels were a little salty but we were warned by our waitress beforehand. \n- 2nd course: rabbit ravioli, garden lasagna (has meat). Lasagna was absolutely mind blowing with the hints of truffle, ravioli was good too, but lasagna was better. \n- 3rd course: veal cheek, whole orata fish with the crushed tomato sauce. GO WITH THE WHOLE FISH. It was incredible, he finished his dish and started picking at mine. Best dish of the night. Fish was soft and the sauce was INCREDIBLE. \n- Dessert: four cheese cheesecake, blueberry panna cotta. Both were good, would go with the cheesecake though. Boyfriend finished it in less than a minute, didn't really share...\n\n(sidenote about this visit: suuuuuper crowded and a table of 6 next to us held up the table for 45+ minutes waiting for 3 people. waiters and managers were getting pissed since other people were waiting, so we were rushed a little at the end to pick up our check and leave. But we were fine with it!! Super small place and not okay to hold up a table on a busy night)\n\n\nSECOND TIME: \n- 1st course: meatball, grilled shrimp salad. Meatball was good, sauce was great. Grilled shrimp salad was great!! Shrimp was sweet and not overcooked, it was like a small burst of flavor in your mouth!\n- 2nd course: Lasagna, sea diver scallop bucatini. Lasagna was amazing just like the first time, came prettier than the first time too. We practically licked the plate. Sea diver bucatini was amazing as well, scallops went really well with the bucatini. \n- 3rd course: Branzino, whole orata fish. Branzino was small in portion compared to the orata, but the meat was soft and smooth, good flavor but nothing like the orata. Again, it was amazing and I would recommend anyone coming to get the whole fish. \n- Dessert: cheesecake, different from the first time (i asked my boyfriend if he remembered what type and all he said was delicious), and raspberry panna cotta with white chocolate.

We finished the night off with a desert, the names evades me at this moment but it had chocolate, ice cream and marshmallows (delicious).

During my experience it was dark outside, so the dining room was very dimly lit to allow a spectacular view of the city's lights. We could see outside for miles and couldn't stop staring all night long. While taking in the view, we enjoyed the most incredible appetizers. Our absolute favorite was the pressed truffle bread. Wow. We ended up ordering more  because of how mouthwatering it was. We wanted to lick the plate clean! We also ordered the shrimp cocktail, as well as the lobster Mac and cheese. The shrimp came with a seasoning on top which in my opinion really boldened the flavor. The lobster Mac and cheese was delicious as well, but the cheese was just a bit too thick for my liking. The presentation, however, was very unique. I've never seen Mac and cheese served in a long, skinny, boat shaped dish. Lastly, I ordered a sangria and it was one of the best sangrias I have ever had! It was very flavorful and fruity, without much of an alcoholic taste. \nFor our entrees, I enjoyed the shrimp and scallops, while my other half had the fluke and scallops. Although the portion size was small, the scallops were HUGE. They also melted in my mouth. By the end of the night we actually found ourselves completely stuffed, but to complete our date, our waiter brought out a small cake plate for Valentine's Day.

The good thing is you can watch a movie while eating decent food and also not be bothered by the wait staffs trying to get everyones orders. Now the bad - if you plan to actually buy ticket at the counter, be prepared for a loooong wait. Its a small space to wait in line with few ticket staff. If you buy ticket online and try to do what the email notification tells you(i.e. go to the kiosk in the theater and printout the tickets) the kiosks RARELY ever work. And then you will find out, the email notification is just enough and you just wasted 10 mins banging your head against a kiosk! \nIf the show is full, well good luck trying to get your food order taken - it can be a short wait or it can be a 30 min wait. Few of the servers will serve the water/drinks pretty sloppily. Also there have been times when my order has been messed up - entree came in with no appetizer ever turning up but being charged for(it was fixed). Last time a waiter other than the waiter who actually took our order, gave us our check but then our original waiter came by and said - naa thats not the right one...go figure!\nHowever there have been times the food order has been seamless and has made the movie watching experience even more enjoyable.

I could have passed on the sliders, the meat was slightly over cooked (and i typically like medium well so that's saying something) and the bun was nothing special and the aioli just tasted like mustard and horseradish.

It is not only a beautiful restaurant, but the staff is very friendly as well as the menu is amazing.\n\nOne thing I have to say, as they do have a lot of Napa wines, but you do have to pay for them. The wine prices are not NAPA valley friendly LOL. My wife and I have frequented wineries throughout our 30 year marriage. Our favorites include silver oak, Cakebread, Mondavi, Joseph Phelps, stags leap, Cakebread. They have them all. \n\nI called ahead and made reservations. We were sat immediately in a very comfortable booth. I ordered my usual Cadillac margarita, my wife had a peach drink (orchard sewing) that was on the drink list. She really enjoyed it.\n\nWhat we ordered:\nCadillac margarita on the rocks \nOrchard swing cocktail\n\nSix oysters on the half shell\nNapa spring salad\nCaprese tomato salad\nBacon wrap scallops\n14 ounce prime rib medium rare\n\nBurger and fry dessert LOL really not kidding. (well sort of kidding because it was mimicking a Burger fry and shake. )\n\nIt took quite a while to get the cocktails. well over 15 minutes. Not sure why, the place was not really busy. I actually had to kind of remind the waitress. The second margarita I ordered was the same. Took about 15 minutes. \n\nThey gave a nice bread basket that had three different types of bread in them. After getting the cocktails, we ordered our food.\n\nThe waitress told us they were out of the slow cooked prime rib. My son was very disappointed because he been asking for prime rib for at least six months. She said she would check and see if she can have one of the primes from the steakhouse. They were able to accommodate my son with a very beautiful cut of prime rib.\n\nThe two salads and the oysters arrive fairly quickly. One enjoyable thing about the oysters is they gave a sauce plate that had more than just cocktail sauce. There was a dill sauce, a cucumber sauce, and some other sauce. They were fresh and delicious. The prime rib and scallop dish arrive fairly soon after our salads. I have to admit that was the largest scallop I've ever seen. It was as tall as the bacon was. It was served on a bed of mushroom risotto that was creamy. It was a little overcooked and mushy, but definitely really good tasting. The prime rib a stick and It was served with sauteed broccoli cauliflower and fingerling potatoes. My son enjoyed the cream horseradish so much that he actually ate every bit of the horseradish before finishing his steak. \n\nFor dessert they have a very interesting burger and fry platter that made a burger out of a doughnut and brownie with strawberries and Keewee's for pickles and tomatoes. A miniature root beer float, mango fries and a concentrated strawberry syrup to mimic ketchup. Genius really. They also gave us some cotton candy.\n\nOverall a very enjoyable evening. Food was perfect Though waiting 15 minutes for each drink was a bit rough LOL. Also, we actually had to chase down the waitress and hand her the credit card for the check because she just didn't seem to return to the table after dropping it off.

Their crab cakes were just ok too, again, it was way too salty but it wasn't bad to the point that I wasn't able to finish it. We also ordered their jumbo lump crab chowder, this chowder was phenomenal, we killed the whole bowl it was so rich and so flavorful. We got their seabass as our entree to share and added the truffle corn risotto, the seabass was very nicely done and with gorgeous presentation as well, I think it's the prettiest dish out of all, I really like the texture of the seabass that it wasn't over cooked, it was crispy outside but not chewy inside, and the asparagus that came with it was also cooked well. The truffle corn risotto was also great, I liked it a lot, it was very creamy but not overly salty and they somehow was still able to make it rich in flavor. Overall the foods were all fresh and nicely done. \n\nThe ambiance in this restaurant reminded me of the Venetian in Vegas, it's very classy looking and I like how they seated each table apart so people could dine and still have some privacy (also social distancing due to covid).

When I was in workin in city this place was  my first choice for special Client /team work dinners and hanging with friends after work.  My BFF wanted to take me out for my post birthday  celebration for dinner so I booked  reservation on RESY ( so easy BTW , love the app but wish for points like me Open Table). I was so excited  now that the bar is open and the restaurant has opened inside to 50%. Eating outside had been an option for a while. They built genius comfy booths on the street, however the exquisite decorated ambiance  was what I yearned for after eating take out for so long. I was looking forward to what I remembered the delicious and beautiful food, high quality tequila drinks, stellar service, friendly staff and cool ambiance of the restaurant.\nWhen we arrived we were greeted by a charismatic friendly host at the door. The restaurant inside was buzzing with a vibrant vibe as we walked past the bar and tables. We sat at a 2 seater against the window overlooking the street and alley. Very cool city view to people watch as people walked through the alley walking their cute dogs. A kind man waived at us and lifted his little dog to the window so we could see him and say HI. My friend captured a pic. What a touching experience and memory. \nOur server came to our table right away after we were seated end was super helpful in describing the margaritas and other drinks. My friend went for the traditional margarita on the rocks and I got the red sangria . The sangria was excellent! Lots of fresh fruit and I could taste the infusion of fruit juices. \nNext we had the queso dip with chorizo ( my fave in the past) Yummy as I had it before!  And for the signature entree : The molcajete beef. Super comfort with bubbling suave of chilled and spices and tender beef in a large mortar bowl. Just as I remember fro the past dinners. Rice and beans beautifully presented on the side. And...blue tortillas! The highlight... blue tortillas! So delicious! \nAfter eating the delicious food I wish I had room for desert- Tres leches cake is epic as I remember. Next time for sure.\n\nWe were looking for a post dinner hang out and decide to hang at the bar. Why not as the gorgeous crystal chandelier was illuminating and the decor took us back to being in a fancy palace. The  bartender was so friendly and made us feel so welcomed. My friend is a Spanish teacher who lived in Mexico and enjoyed conversation with the wait staff as they were picking up drinks . The jalape\u00f1o margarita is the bomb! My friend had a palamo grapefruit tequila. \nShe is Spanish teacher and also loves Mexican and Latin cuisine and she enjoyed conversation with the staff as they were picking up their drink orders \nWay at a wonderful experience!

Your cover will be blown when you get lost trying to find the entrance to Ranstead Room, as it's an unmarked door in a dark alley that you've never walked down before, and you are terrified. \n\nFortunately once you enter the bar, it's so dimly lit that no one will be able to tell you were profusely sweat-panicking just a few minutes before. Actually, it's so dark in there that this is an excellent choice if you are breaking out, having a bad hair day, or \"look tired.\" I suspect it's a popular Hinge date destination for similar reasons. \n\nThe decor is what you'd expect for a speakeasy, complete with tasteful, vintage paintings of scantily clad women. This is a great opportunity to find out what kind of person you're on a date with. For example, if you comment on the paintings and they respond with, \"Oh, so you like nudes, eh?\" it's probably a good indicator that the evening is not going to go well.\n\nCue the cocktails. If you're a vodka drinker and have a sweet tooth, the Coco Chanel is what you're ordering.  Coconut milk, ginger, lime, and vodka- so refreshing, it's almost as if you're sipping this drink on a beach in sunny Mexico instead of listening to your date pretend their French-Canadian accent is thicker than it probably is. If you're in the mood for a \"healthy\" cocktail, order the \"What's Up Doc?\"- lots of tequila with a splash of carrot juice, lemon, and honey.  \n\nRanstead Room is one to check out if you're into killer cocktails, speakeasy vibes, ... and nudes.

My husband said it sounds like the cars were in the room lol. I'd suggest sleeping with ear plugs or bringing a white noise machine with you if you have trouble blocking out intrusive sounds.  That's the only one of two downsides to our stay. \n\nNOW to the positives because there are plenty!\n\nCheck-in was a breeze and the customer service from everyone at the front desk was amazing. Normally I walk away with a bit of worry but every question I may have had was answered fully. \n\nThe package I purchased included a breakfast buffet in the club lounge however due to covid breakfast is now at the restaurant on the second floor and it just gets charged to the room then zeroed out at check-out supposedly we shall see at the end of my stay when I get the folio. I'm doing this review in real time so by the end you'll get all the nitty gritty. \n\nThe rooms are decently spacious. CLEAN.However I feel jipped with these double beds felt like I was back in college fighting over mattress space with my husband lol. Sheraton could really benefit from having Queen beds. The beds were perfect for my two toddlers to share though. The price I'm paying for this room doesn't correlate with the bed is all I'm saying. There were plenty plugs in the room for all our charging needs! There are 4 plugs 2 on each side of the night stand. Invest in a dual charging block or bring a surge protector if you need to plug in a lot of stuff close to the bed. \n\nValet was simple Jazmine went over everything I needed to know to get my car back and was very pleasant and warm. You text a number to get your car and they'll text you back when it's downstairs ready for you takes about 15 minutes. However valet was crazy at night the line to get to the front door stretched down the street.\n\nNow these are some fancy elevators and they're fast. So instead of pressing a number inside the elevator you type in what floor you need to go to outside and then it tells you which letter elevator to go to. No more having to worry about your kid playfully pressing buttons. \n\nThere's a Starbucks in the lobby but perks of club level I can get some for free in the club room but if you want specialty coffees and fraps the lobby is where you'll be headed. \n\nThere's also a doggy area right outside the property it's gated and big enough for your fur babies to roam and do their business. \n\nMasks are required in public areas and vaccination cards or a negative PCR tests for dining areas and restaurants as we were asked to show them when we went to Coteries for dinner.\n\nBreakfast was buffet style but you hand them your plate. These grits were phenomenal! I didn't have to add anything to them. Everything taste great and fresh. People please stop fussing.\n\nWhew checkout was a rollercoaster but with Tequila or however you spell her name. she kept moving her name tag to where it wasn't fully visible but to be an Envoy Elite member and treated in a dismissive manner put a damper on what was a great trip. I'm not sure if the overwhelming amount of people who were there for other events got to her but she could've told me she needed a moment and I would have totally understood. I had questions about my bill but another clerk came over with an issue from a guest they were helping and they totally forgot about me. Thankfully Sarah came and asked if I needed help since I was still standing there lol but she addressed my concerns with the bill because it was$230 more than I was to be charged initially. \n\nAll in all I would definitely come back but would book a king bed suite for more space for my family.

There was one time, where it appeared that it took 5 workers, to deal with one guests lost car keys issue.  Why did I have to be impacted by that if there were enough workers to get my car, while one person could have dealt with his lost car keys issue.  \n\nI also have to say that they need to highly invest in new remote controls for their televisions.   Trying to use their television remote had to be one of the most frustrating experiences of my stay.\n\nThe remote was slow to react to every press of the button.  There were times that I had to pray to keep myself from wanting to just throw the remote at the television.  \n\nEven when I scanned the code to use my phone as the remote, I had the same issue.  Please fix this so that your guests can have a more pleasant stay.  It should not take almost 30 minutes to log into Netflix because the television is slow to react to the remote.  \n\nOn another note, I inquired about a refrigerator before I traveled.  I was told that my concerns would be forwarded.  I was given the impression that a refrigerator would be available.  \n\nThere was no talk about a first come first serve basis on refrigerators before I traveled.  Yet, when I called the staff like 4 times regarding a refrigerator, I was told that they would check.  \n\nIt's okay to check.  It's even okay to even not have one if they are all checked out.  Yet, the issue is that the staff NEVER followed up with me regarding whether they had a refrigerator or not.  \n\nThe staff simply ghosted me each time and never followed up.  This is downright disrespectful.  You should at least call to let your guests know whether they will be accommodated or not.  \n\nThere were also times that I called the staff, and no one picked up the phone.", "date": "2021-12-20 04:01:18", "user": {"name": "Chris", "review_count": 180, "yelping_since": "2013-03-07 22:42:45", "elite": "2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.34, "fans": 6}}, {"review_id": "bRJ0xXAbAyh9W4ebS8pw2A", "user_id": "74GRQDIiK6kk-MSVcI_Vsw", "business_id": "zljfjg_zTL3ceGi_Vr4OFw", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "phoenician and crystal at the front desk lack the ability to function at a corporate level, it's appalling that they are employed here in the first place.

The next day, one was in the shower. \n\nThe \"upgrade\" given as a loyal and revered Bonvoy member was an Executive Suite with Club Access but A) to get to the club we had to go to an entirely different building and it took two elevator rides to get there. Fine.  But when we got there there were small bags of potato chips, two types of granola bars and that was it, no matter what time of day you arrived. All four days we were there the Espresso Beans were never refilled. I get that it's \"Covid Tome\" but have some imagination. At 5 pm, put out individually wrapped crackers, cheeses and veggies.\nSmall bottles of wine or something that makes me feel like a valued Bonvoy Member. \n\nAnd why is it that everywhere I went on the lobby, it smelled like Dank Weed?!?\n\nThe restaurant was a disaster. We had \"coupons\" for breakfast. The first day they handed us a menu with limited options, I get it. \nThe second day we were shown to our table and TOLD there's the buffet, enjoy. \nI didn't want the buffet. There were no other options given. \nSo I went to the buffet, which is more money than the \"meal tickets\" allowed for which is unexpected.\nHere's what I found on the buffet: \nThere were flies in the bread rack, the pancakes were, literally, cold and hard. The eggs were inedible and the sausage links were fry, overcooked and tasteless. The fruit cup was old, and was clearly from a previous meal.  And on the second day they made us get our own coffee and carry it to our table without providing saucers. \nThere were no saucers to catch the coffee that splashed as I walked.  And other than someone Seating us and handing us a bill, no one ever came to our table.  I finally lost my appetite completely when I realized just how dusty and dirty the banquet seating and chair rail were. I'm pretty sure it hasn't been dusted since Louisiana was purchased.\nAnd why, for the love of goodness are people in the portico selling weed?  I can tell you. Probably to service all the college kid's who were staying 8 to a room across the hall from us. Thank goodness we travel with ear plugs and a sound machine because we would not have been able to sleep at all otherwise. \nAnd finally, the bed linen. The comforter was stained with blood and looked and smelled like it hadn't been washed in months. Thank goodness I bring my own comforter and pillows. \nCompletely dissatisfied and disgusted with this sloppy, unrefined waste of my time. It's almost as if they said \"Hey!

Although the unfortunate event occured off of the hotel property, here's where this particular Hilton did me DIRTY!\nAfter the altercation, my drunken relative high tailed it back to The Hilton, ahead of me and proceeded to lock herself in the room, keeping me from getting inside. It was just after midnight. Feeling distressed and increasingly embarrassed by all that was developing, I went to the hotel's front desk for assistance and was handled like an idiot. I was told by a so-called night manager named Vincent Howard, with a smile, that it was best that I leave. He reasoned that although the room was registered under MY name and paid for with MY credit card, my relative was also a guest there and that they had no right to remove her from the room. Vincent Howard flatly explained all of this to me as I stood in the hallway feeling foolish and defeated. While I was being talked down to like a child, my relative was allowed to remain on the other side of the door, drunk out of her mind, loudly babbling and threatening to fight me. There was a very nasty hotel security guard who accompanied the night manager to the room, threatening to remove us both from the hotel which would've made more sense than what actually happened in the end. \nMy relative was allowed to plunder through my luggage, smash a few items and pack my stuff for me. Most insulting, they locked her in the bathroom where she continued to rant and rave, rushed me into the room to get my things and offered me the opportunity to wait in the lobby for my phone to charge before leaving The Hilton altogether. I was never offered another room or a refund. Thank God some of the other ladies on this trip had accomadations at a Marriott Hotel in the area. I was able to bunk with them. \nMy Hilton experience was embarrassing and hurtful. I will never forgive or forget the garbage staff for how awful they treated me in the midst of a family fallout.

Also be prepared to wrestle with your door handle in numerous unexpected ways to get it to open.\n\nThis is a hotel geared towards convention-goers, so, apart from its location, probably not ideal for a \"staycation\", which is what my girlfriends and I used it for last weekend. The hotel itself is in good shape, the carpeting in the halls and in the rooms don't show too much wear. The lobby is unimpressive but clean. The pool is much smaller than it looks in photos but well maintained and there are ample pool towels, unlike the situation at some other hotel pools. The pool is near the exhaust fans for Dragos, so know that you will smell food cooking while in the pool. \n\nWe were able to check in an hour early and the room was clean and had nice bath products. The view is also lovely. We enjoyed the pool for a couple of hours and then left for dinner and to go out downtown. We got back around midnight and gathered in my friend's room to continue chatting until around 2am. At that time, we walked down the hall to our room and couldn't get in, even though the light on the door turned green. We pushed the handle and door over and over as hard as we could. Nothing. We also tried using the room key on our phone with the app. Nothing.\n\nSo we headed (in our pajamas) to the elevator bank to go to the lobby, assuming we had an issue with our room key. Pushed the button. Five minutes passed, then ten. Then fifteen. (We started timing after 5 minutes). Then twenty. At 15 minutes we picked up the phone in the little cabinet next to the elevators. Spoiler alert, nothing happens when you dial that phone pursuant to the directions. It is purely decoration. I did call the lobby with my cell phone. When I was able to speak to a person, he could not explain or help with the elevator situation. \n\nAnother important side note: the hotel's elevator banks are divided into 2, with one bank servicing the bottom half of hotel floors, and the other bank servicing the top half of hotel floors. Each hotel bank has 5 elevators. FIVE. \n\nFor over twenty minutes, at 2am, my friend and I listened to elevators periodically whizzing up and down, without stopping on our floor. There is absolutely no way that all 5 elevators were so busy at 2am that not one could stop on the 13th floor for that amount of time.\n\nBetween the 20 and 25 minute mark, an elevator finally opened. It seemed like a mirage. But it did in fact deliver us to the lobby, where a man and woman were at the front desk, complaining about being locked out of their room. Interesting. When it was our turn at last, the front desk clerk dispatched security to help. The security officer came up to our door and watched us struggle and then suggested we lift UP on the handle. Notably, NONE of the times we had previously opened the door did we have to lift up on the handle. Ever. After wrestling the handle up and doing some maneuvering, the door finally opened. \n\nThe issue here isn't that some doors are apparently quite temperamental. The issue is that our epic 2am journey could have been entirely prevented if we had simply been advised at check in that the door may not open the same way every time, and that you may have to be quite forceful with it. I have stayed in hundreds of hotels over the years and never once had an experience like this one. \n\nAt the cafe getting coffee the following morning, we overheard several other guests complaining about the wait for elevators. When we warily attempted to head down and access the lobby for coffee (around 8 am), two other guests were standing by the elevators and informed us that they had already been waiting for over 5 minutes for an elevator. About 5 minutes later (so about a 10 minute wait), an elevator arrived.  When checking out, around 11am, we also had to wait about 10 minutes for an elevator. Inexplicably, though, the wait in the lobby to get an elevator to a higher floor was never long. \n\nSo, although there are some positives here, I cannot recommend this hotel. We were plainly not the only people who repeatedly waited an exorbitantly long time for an elevator, nor were we the only people who had trouble with the door. While our situation was not dire, just inconvenient, it is easy to imagine scenarios where it would be (a child in the room alone; a guest feeling sick and just wanting to get back to their room; a computer or presentation materials in the room and a deadline or scheduled presentation put in jeopardy).", "date": "2021-08-16 17:05:49", "user": {"name": "Courtney", "review_count": 209, "yelping_since": "2008-07-23 19:45:48", "elite": "2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.6, "fans": 46}}, {"review_id": "KXrfQHc6sOjVad2OYrGGuQ", "user_id": "qGXxZY6TGKgaOKLg6ai7wA", "business_id": "u-wkhjV7CfvGJVY7hGULjw", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Nice place to stay but bring supplies to snack and drink.

Pay the extra few bucks to include self-parking. It's totally worth it (can go in and out unlimited). The outlet mall (which has another location of cafe du monde) and actual high end mall are also right across the street, along with harrah's casino. Drago's restaurant is downstairs - I'm not a  big fan, but folks do flock it, so maybe the cocktails are good? There's also a small convenience store in the 2nd floor (not 24/7).  Didnt check out the pool, but was told one of the two is currently being renovated. \n\nService at the desk was lovely. They were super nice and helpful. \n\nRooms itself can use an upgrade - carpet and tv are outdated. Beds are pretty comfy, though. \n\nIt was also very tricky to get in and out of our room with a stroller. Granted we had a corner room that had the view of the city and the River  - which was really awesome since my kid was super entertained with the cars and boats. Also, we decided to eat in our room once at sunset, by the window, with take out food and that was also nice. Room came with a small fridge with no freezer, and no microwave. Coffee maker and blow dryer were provided. Shampoo/conditioner/hand soap provided, but nothing very low end. \n\nThe sink in our bathroom didn't drain well so that was inconvenient since we have a kid and we do a lot of \"washing\" (utensils, bottles, etc). Shower pressure was great. \n\nIf you're sensitive to noise, ask for a room away from the elevator AND the ice machine. We asked for a room from the elevator,  but we didn't think of the ice machine. \n\nAll in all, it was a good stay. Now, we did find a bottle of coke in the fridge, but we just went ahead and chucked that out. No big deal.

This pretty gorgeous place in a dope new city and state for me to discover. High ceilings with rooms overlooking the front desk and loung area of a awesome restaurant named Dragos. (check that review out. You won't be disappointed) Front desk staff was super friendly and helped me with a upgrade on my room too. Big thumbs up on that my guy. The room is nice and spacious. The only issue is it has TWO conjoined room doors. Guest on both side crazy loud. But hey it's NOLA and it's spring break. we go out and enjoy the food fair and sites that NOLA has to offer. (Swamp tour was beyond fun by the way.) upon our return from the swamp tour we get texts from our banking provider of clearly fraudulent charge attempts.. (by the way ppl always let your bank know when you're traveling. It'll save you major headaches in case of situations just like this) we get back to the room and to what do we see... OUR luggage, drawers and closets are all ran through. The safe didn't work so nothing was stored in it. The thieves stole a few valuables that could fit on their bodies because all the big cash cow items like our Mirrorless cameras and, drone and shoes and all were left alone. They stole off body wallets and AirPods. The thing is all that is easily replaceable. So that's not the big thing to sweat over. The thing that's bad is the management has done nothing and technically turned a blind eye to this. There's only two keys and we have both of them. We turned down room service at the front desk upon arrival. We want NO ONE to have access to our room especially during the covid times. Management hasn't come and spoken to us about any type of compensation to remedy this unfortunate situation or anything. They've been very dismissive of it. I shouldn't have to reach out to them after we filed a report of a situation on YOUR premises. Your job as a supposed prestigious hospitality is to always insure that you've delivered satisfactory service to your patrons. You should be reaching out to US to help ensure that this unfortunate situation can be rectified on your end. Very dissatisfied with the service and level of treatment. Hotel security is more helpful than its own hotel management. At this point. We know it's a inside job. The police reports been filed and this a black mark will have to stay until I get a better outcome to this situation. Which lets be honest. I won't hold my breath on. Other than that.

We made a reservation on open table for late on Saturday night. Luckily we arrived early for the reservation, because the parking situation is tough. There is parking, but it's shared with several other businesses and we had to circle the lot a couple times to wait for someone to be leaving. \n\nOnce inside, we were greeted by a host and told that the QR code on the host stand is how we would be able to access the menu. Pretty standard but I didn't realize when first told that we needed to open the menu while in the lobby because the QR code wasn't available on the table. No biggie, but I had a difficult time hearing the host speaking in the loud lobby. \n\nWe were sat at our table and ordered the lamb loli chops and watermelon salad to start while we decided on some more food and drinks. The server was maybe a little confused because of how we were ordering, but the apps came out quickly and that's what we wanted to do, so what can I say?! \n\nWe shared and both were super impressed with the lamb. Perfectly seasoned and seared, just remembering it is making my mouth water. \n\nI really loved the watermelon salad - the watermelon was juicy and a little salty and spicy. So good and not exactly what I expected. \n\nNext, we shared the bass. Again, everything on the plate was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I really loved the tomato & leek sauce on the plate. \n\nFor dessert, we got the skillet cookie -- what the server said was a crowd favorite -- and the peach pound cake. Pound cake is made with local peaches, served with a peach compote, maple bourbon ice cream, and some caramelized pecans. Every element was tasty and went so well together. \n\nThe skillet cookie might have been my favorite thing of the night. Sweet and salty, with such a great crisp on the outside and gooey inside... combined with the melty ice cream running down, it was perfection.  \n\nOverall, we would eat any of these dishes again, especially the lamb and cookie. The service was good but I would have preferred a little less talking -- as in, not interrupting in the middle of a conversation to say that you're putting a spoon down or that something is coming soon. It didn't make the experience bad by any means, because I appreciate that the service was attentive and we were given information about menu and such, but for a date night and being in the midst of conversation most of the times the server came back, I'd have preferred that not every touch point involved an explanation. \n\nAnyway, we'll absolutely be back for some more fantastic food.", "date": "2021-08-15 13:14:48", "user": {"name": "Jessica", "review_count": 73, "yelping_since": "2015-04-30 04:57:22", "elite": "2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.44, "fans": 6}}, {"review_id": "zB20eIVjB84HqQ0Z2Sbzzw", "user_id": "aWiVWtlDL8ejUSMHN9r0IQ", "business_id": "feWbeHR9_O0yhxJqmyACXw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 3, "text": "Reservations are a must.

Instead of the expected holiday carols, we were treated to a (another) rousing edition of Billy Joel's Piano Man. \n\nSo then, why not kick back and enjoy the sounds of the season with a glass of Bourbon Barrel-Aged Spiced Sangria? 1000 Stories Bourbon Barrel-Aged Zinfandel with Washington Hills Merlot mixed with brandy, fresh lime juice, fresh orange juice, and a blend of vibrant spices were just the right concoction to set the holiday mood.\n\nOnce our orders were placed, a nice assortment of bread was brought to the table for us to snack on. Served with a generous helping of olive oil to dip it in to.\n\nI ordered the Prime Ribeye, 12 ounces of delicious beef cooked to a perfect medium rare and served with a serving of Yukon mashed potatoes. For my side, I ordered the Fresh Tillamook Cheddar Creamed Corn with \nApplewood bacon and smothered in Tillamook cheese.\n\nEverything was fantastic! We ended our meal, and the evening, with a shared piece of Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was candy coated and topped with fresh whipped cream and raspberry sauce. Muah! Chefs kiss!!

The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the crab mixture on top (not really stuffed) was rich & full. \n\nSides were also great. The fries were crispy and well seasoned.

First we were left to sit for an excessively long time waiting to order. Randall was seemingly annoyed with his job and was unable to hide his displeasure while waiting on our table. I ordered a glass of wine and that was met with a scoff, I was sort of surprised at first considering we were one of three tables in the restaurant. I was willing to over look it...and it all went down hill from there. We waited a long time to place our order and when we did he did the absolute bare minimum in terms of interaction with us...as in he stood there and we ordered. He didn't even speak to us, it was so strange. Our first two courses came out and then we waited nearly 30 minutes for our third (main) course. All the while we haven't seen Randall again, the kitchen runners were delivering our food (very pleasant btw). After finishing our third course the restaurant started to pick up. We sat and watched Randall approach and wait on several other tables. Nearly 20 minutes passed after we had finished eating our third course and he failed to stop at our table a single time despite the fact that neither of us had touched any more of our food. It was so incredibly strange. We finally stopped him after he attended to the table immediately behind ours as he was walking by still completely ignoring us. We asked to place our dessert order, again not saying anything he stared at us blankly while we ordered. He did come back with spoons, which he placed on the table beside all of our finished plates. At this point it took everything I had not to ask him what his problem was but I refrained. He continued to wait on other tables while leaving all of the dinner dishes on our table when he finally came over to take them. I specifically looked directly at him and said thank you. He did not look at me and again did not say a word. It was the strangest and rudest dining experience I have ever had in my life and I can't even begin to understand why. We ate our dessert and again had to ask for our check. He dropped it off and eventually forced my dining mate to approach him at the computer to ask him to run the card because it had now been 2.5 hours since we sat down despite other tables coming and going. After paying the bill lest anyone think we were trying to get something for free (you see it all when you serve tables) we asked to speak to the man in the vest and explained what had happened, although apologetic I can say w/o a doubt we will not return. \n\nThe service was so bad that I am very sincerely contemplating calling the manager tomorrow to follow up because I can't imagine they run their restaurant like this on the regular. Atrocious service completely ruined the experience. \n\nThe bathroom was filthy, I went three different times (2.5 hours there) in three different stalls. Not a one had toilet paper. Also, several of the faucets I approached were broken. \n\nThe food was average overall. \n\nFirst Course: Mulligatawny Soup (grainy texture, well seasoned, overall decent) and Samosa Chaat (average)\n\nSecond Course: Naga Beef Sumi (delicious, well cooked and the peanut-cucumber relish was delicious) Gobhi Manchurian (normally one of my favorite Indian fares, disgusting. It was like vegetarian chicken wings doused in bar b que sauce. Do not recommend) \n\nThird Course: Old Delhi Butter Chicken (perfectly cooked and very well seasoned sauce. One of the better I've had) Lamb Vindaloo (good, exactly as expected, perfectly average, Lamb was tough)\n\nFourth Course: Tashan Cr\u00e8me Brulee (Not even a Brulee fan, and this was amazing! Its the only thing about the place that lives up to the hype) Spiced Molten Chocolate Cake (my dining partner nailed it when he described it as a stale Little Debbie)", "date": "2015-08-05 05:52:38", "user": {"name": "Jessalyn", "review_count": 20, "yelping_since": "2013-07-11 17:10:39", "elite": "", "average_stars": 4.4, "fans": 0}}, {"review_id": "W8vqlIcwIj2If2Eexf5k6g", "user_id": "yOLXoEGrpIxsWGfihJjZFA", "business_id": "H3EK1Q8tqRGqPBps05Uahw", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "Ok so Tashan I am disappointed \nThe food was not bad.... but it was not great!!!

Additionally, I went here on a Sunday and upon going inside they have a list of daily specials, Sunday's special is \"Industry Night, 20% off your entire bill\".

First time a year or two ago on a Groupon we did the chef's tasting menu and loved it.  So it stuck in our minds and we came back recently for a replay at full price for a birthday dinner.  With tax and tip, a $150 meal for two for Indian food in Philly.  That's a pretty high bar to rise to.  That's like 15 buffet lunches in West Philly!  That's like dinner for 4-6 people at any of the more upscale places.  So it better be pretty spectacular,  And I have to say, at full price, I was a little disappointed.  First of all the menu has not changed at all from our last visit, and it's pretty small- especially for vegetarian offerings. So we were eating most of the same food.  Secondly, not all dishes are all that creative or interesting.  The entrees in fact were competently typical American Indian restaurant fare, palak paneer and butter chicken (which an Indian friend told me is more British than Indian) and completely skippable.  The small plates were very nice as before, creative and tangy and just the right level of spice. But they were identical to before.  The goat cheese pastry thing was tasty but not the slightest bit Indian, and not as good as what I've had in French places .The rice was dry and the bread was boring.  Last time they had given us two beautiful stuffed nan choices.  This time it was one plain nan and one garlic nan, neither of which I can get excited about (especially for a $150 dinner) and neither of which was among the best I've had.  Gulab jamon-creme brulee fusion dessert was indeed brilliant and tasty and unique and I enjoyed it- but again exactly same as before.  We did get a few new things this time as my wife is a carnivore and we ordered one veg and one non-veg tasting menu, and she reported that the lamb chops were good and salmon mediocre.  But all in all it seems that we simply got fewer food choices by splitting it up between veg and non veg.  So, in the end, maybe if this had been a half-price Groupon I could have enjoyed it more or seen better value.  As is, I am giving my rating on the quality and variety of food for the full price charged, hence the 3 stars.  I don't think we'll be craving this place or rushing back any more.  And if we do, we are done with the overpriced tasting menus and would stick to ordering a number of small plates and not bother with the entrees.

To start, George did not come to our table for about 10 minutes once we were seated. Once he did, he started walking away halfway through our drinks order (a few ppl wanted coffee to perk up). He barely made eye contact, didn't introduce himself or even half-smile, and was clearly distracted.\n\nDistracted by what? One might ask --- well, George had a couple other tables that I guess he assumed would yield bigger tips than what he would get from a group of 5 young professional women. Bad assumption, George. \n\nAfter dropping off our coffee and waters, George proceeded to make 3-4 visits to his other tables (one with two middle aged couples and one with a group that appeared to be parents and their  grown children) before returning to our table to discuss appetizers and specials. In fact, we watched helplessly as George blatantly looked away several times when we tried to make eye contact with him to signal we were ready to order.  I would be surprised if he didn't have whiplash he was turning his head so quickly.\n\nWhen we finally got his attention, we ordered several appetizers to start. We all have been to Kanella several times and are familiar with the menu. At that point, in an attempt to save some face, George informed us he thought we were waiting for a 6th person, as there was an empty chair at the table. Nice try, George. At that point, only a fool would think the table place covered in wine bottles, menus, and purses was going to be taken. Instead of having a laugh about it and getting on better terms, though, George rushed away again. \n\nOur apps came out and we ran out of pita quickly. It took us 10 min to get George's attention to order more pita/bread to enjoy with our dip heavy appetizers. When he finally came over, the first thing he said, and rather rudely was, \"are you going to order any entrees?\". Not would you like to order entrees?, or would you like to hear the specials?--- it was more like a demand to suggest we were wasting his time and costing him money. He said he needed to know because most of the entrees take a while to cook and prepare. That's funny, though, because just the other week, I had a lamb stew and pork souvlaki appear pretty quickly post-order--- don't ya think, George, there might be a more polite way to address a customer? I digress. When we informed him we just wanted to order a few rounds of apps, his expression fell flat, his shoulders dropped, and we were officially invisible. We went ahead and ordered the rest of ours appetizers, several rounds worth, and knew we would be seeing very little of George until check out time. \n\nAs our apps came out, our dirty plates failed to be removed in a timely manner, and George didn't return once to see that we were enjoying our meal. I know that clearing of the plates is the busser's responsibility, but I also know a good server makes sure it happens. George seemed shocked when we ordered 2 desserts, how could a bunch of female YPs afford it?, and I don't remember him even saying thank you for coming in. What didn't George forget to do? Add a 20% gratuity to our bill. Touch\u00e9, George. I guess you win. \n\nAll the appetizers/desserts were delicious but the meal was ruined by our server's prejudice against our group. No one should walk into a restaurant and be treated a certain way because of their demographic. Guess what, George --- joke's on you. We are the types of young adults that regularly come here with our parents when they are in town and run up the high tabs you were chasing after with those other tables.

I raised my eye at pumpkin in the spring, but  the added herbs/green onion made it light and springy.The lamb was extremely tender and did not have the oiliness a lot of restaurant lamb stews drown in.

She loved it, which is saying a lot considering how picky of an eater she is, and needless to say I was very satisfied with my meal. The portion sizes are just right in my opinion - while some dishes may be more substantial, they contain, for the most part, just the right amount.\n\nThe restaurant itself is fairly low key with a nice Mediterranean vibe. The wait staff is also extremely friendly.

I absolutely love Greek/Mediterranean food and Kanella does it best. I'm definitely a little sad that they have outgrown their cozy little BYO on Spruce and are moving further east to a larger location with a liquor license... but that won't stop me from going the extra distance, either. \n\nAt dinner or brunch, we always start with the trio of spreads. This is the only time I have ever eaten beets and enjoyed them (pureed with who knows what but this spread is delicious). The pumpkin feta spread is wonderful as well, and I'll always love the potato and onion spread. While I love the pita, I have been trying to cut back on carbs and I was able to get a side of veggies on my Friday night visit, which was awesome. \n\nLately when we go for dinner, my fianc\u00e9 and I order a handful of small plates and just share everything over a couple courses. The octopus with white beans is excellent, as well as the grilled halloumi with tomato and fig salad. We recently tried some lamb dumplings which were super flavorful and a little spicy.

This was a really fun and interesting way to sample the menu without trying to juggle the appetizer/entree order ratio. And, it end up being comparable (if not a smidge cheaper) than two entrees would have been.\n\nOur dishes (ranked from favorite to least favorite): \n1. Manti (ground lamb dumplings with yogurt sauce with paprika, mint, and parsley)\n2. Bureki (phyllo dough stuffed with feta & thyme, drizzled with honey, served with roasted beets)\n3. Daily Dips (potato/garlic, red beet, pumpkin/feta)\n4. Grilled octopus\n5. Grilled shrimp skewers with lamb sausage and tabouleh (daily special)\n\nOverall, all of the dishes were supremely flavorful, uniformly fresh, and perfectly sized. \n\nThe Manti (groung lamb dumplings) were by far our favorite dish. The bright, spicy, rich sauce and the tender dumplings were a near-perfect dish. The Burkei (phyllo dough with feta, thyme, and honey) was also near-perfect. The drizzle of honey on top of the light and flaky dough added just the hint of sweetness that balanced the flavors from the feta nicely. \n\nOur favorite of the daily dips was the pumpkin/feta. All three were delicious, but we found the pumpkin/feta and red beet to be the better of the 3. Warm, fresh pita only helped the dish.\n\nThe grilled octopus was really tender and grilled nicely, but we tasted that after our palates had been awakened by the Manti, so the more subtle flavors fell a little flat. The shrimp & lamb sausage skewer was only ok. The dish didn't help or hurt our experience, but I appreciated tasting yet another protein. \n\nI was somewhat underwhelmed by the service. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and take equal responsibility for not requesting our dishes be paced similar to a meal. One of my friends, who has been a number of times, mentioned they have always done this for her, so I kind of expected it.

Hit or miss..\nI ordered two entree dishes with side salad today for my family's lunch as I had to work from home this morning with no time to cook but wanted to serve some warm, decent food for lunch to celebrate surviving a hardworking week including the first couple of back-to-school weeks. It turned out that it was another disappointment from Maggiano's. Some staff is attentive and respectful, but some are not in our past experience. However, food is usually good. My child asked for Maggiano's recently, so I gave it a shot today for pick up. When I arrived at curbside pick up, I texted to the number with my full name and spot # according to instruction on a sign board. Nobody came out for good 10 minutes. Sometimes food prep takes time since I chose for \"ASAP\" for my food ready time, I wouldn't mind giving some extra time for them to cook. However, I sensed something was off. I decided not to wait any longer and went into a store. I haven't been there in person for a while due to pandemic so I wasn't sure where the pick up place was. There were three young people smiling and chatting in their red Maggiano's shirts at the counter. I told them I came for online order pick and gave my name. One young lady nearer to a register pointed out at a shelf next to me where I could see my name on a bag. There was only one bag and no other customer around so they were not busy. I told her that I was waiting at a curbside. She seemed to become defensive and told me that she was busy and alone. I was confused because three of them were enjoying socializing. One lady was sipping a drink, another young man was smiling, and this lady was also chatting with them when I stepped in. I wasn't sure if two of them were on a break, but it was lunch time, the busy time at a restaurant although it wasn't busy day for them today. I wasn't pleasant by her response, but didn't want to waste any more time since my family was waiting. \nWhen I came home and opened containers, another disappointment was waiting. Side caesar salad was already saggy and croutons were wet. I know another restaurant keeping salad order in a cool place until pick up time, but Maggiano's just kept everything in one bag (salad on top of pasta) and didn't even care to bring it out on time when customer was waiting outside for more than 10 minutes. Pasta was cold. I hate using microwave that is reason I chose to pick it up myself instead of choosing delivery. So it seemed that food was ready on time by 11:47am at my pick up time, but it got bad and unfresh since almost 20 minutes of delay was made due to negligent staff who didn't even acknowledge of their wrongdoing but busy hanging out with other peers. Well, I met wonderful servers and staff there before, but had some impolite and negligent staff like today. That is why I am reluctant to choose Maggiano's and we havne't been there for a while although we started to go other eatery places. I wonder if inconsistent service quality is a part of management problem. If they keep checking up on their employees and providing appropriate feedback throughout shift, and before and after, they probably can provide much better service to customers. \nI am very disappointed and uncertain if I would like to place my next order at Maggiano's.

DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY!!! I ordered a pickup order for Mother's day the Friday before. My husband's credit card was charged and we received a confirmation email. At the time of pick up, 4pm, my daughter and husband went to pick it up. After being ignored in the pick up area for 15 minutes, they went in to ask about the order. They were told that his credit card didn't go thru and the order was canceled. My husband asked why we weren't notified, to which he was told that they did which was not true. My husband asked to talk to the manager and he told him that he was very upset that the order was canceled and now he had no dinner for me for Mother's day. The manager answered with \" what's your problem \". Huh? My husband asked to speak to the manager outside so that the busyness of the restaurant wouldn't get in the way of trying to talk and rectify the situation, to which the manager told him that he was going to call the police!!! My husband told him to call the police as he was sure they would have an issue how they were being treated by Maggianos. The restaurant said they would remake the order and get it out to the car as soon as possible. They brought out the order minus asparagus that my daughter ordered. She went back in again to yell them she didn't get her asparagus to which they argued with her saying they did, which is basically calling her a liar, to which my daughter replied, \" do you want me to bring the whole order back in so you can see there is no asparagus\". They said no and made it for her. So after an hour of this ABUSE, BEING THREATENED WITH POLICE AND CALLED A LIAR, they gave my daughter a copy of an email they received from their OWN  corporate office by accident which  said that they couldn't get the credit card to go through, to call us and to prepare our order and inform us that we will be charged at pickup. We have that copy, and all of our original order paperwork. WE WILL NEVER GO TO MAGGIANO'S AND PLAN ON TELLING EVERY ONE WE KNOW OF OUR HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!

My husband and I walked in shortly.   Alice told us that my parents are not up to their dress code.  We were shocked. Mom was wearing cashmere \"jogger\" and host insisted they were sweatpants.  I told her it is my mom's birthday and can't she let it slide?  Nope.  Our car was valeted already.  Hubby took my parents home to change.  Me with two young children cannot be partially seated.  It was difficult.  \n\nThis Alice came over a few times, trying to be nice.   She told us we can wait in the high top area, but cannot be seated.  20 minutes later, she said she can \"partially\" seat us in the basement.  I said no.  The kids are not vaccinated and we made a reservation and the first floor had ample empty tables.  But No, cannot be seated.  Later hubby and parents returned and were told we only can get seated downstairs, because I was not nice to her. \n\n\nGrow up, please.  You sent a 60 year old birthday lady home to change because of your snobby dress code.  The definition of \"business casual\" is quite arbitrary. Sneakers, hoodies are allowed but cashmere joggers are not?   Or hoodies depending on who wears it,according to other reviews here?  You would not seat a mom with two young kids.

My wife went to the table while I waited for the drinks at the bar. When I arrived at the table with our drinks the bread was already placed on the table and was already cold. Our server was wonderful, very pleasant, professional,  and attentive. We started with oysters and calamari, both were excellent. The oysters tasted fresh and the accompanying sauces were delicious. We ordered steaks and sides. My strip med rare and my wifes filet medium. My strip was med well and the filet was rare. My wife decided she would keep hers and let it rest a few minutes. Our server offered to have a new one cooked for me but knowing my wife's food, and the sides, would be cold by the time a new steak arrived I declined. Unfortunately it was not as good at that temperature but it was good still. My suggestion would be to offer to have the drinks brought to our table so we could have been seated together. If a steak temp is incorrect have new sides brought with the newly cooked steaks. The manager did approach us, we assumed because the server mentioned the steak temp to him (the server confirmed our assumption), but he never mentioned this fact but I was almost halfway through my steak and wasn't about to mention it.

When we went back to the host stand we saw someone walking out with a hoodie and asked Alice \"how were they allowed in with a hoodie and we just had to leave and buy new clothes?\" Her response was \"I assure you they were not wearing a hoodie, we apply the dress code to everyone\". Not only was that a dismissive comment but it was also WRONG because when we sat down we saw at least 5 more hoodies (im including photos of some). We pointed it out to another person working there who apologized to us and apologized for their inconsistency. Alice never apologized or said anything. Rude. \n\nIt is not our issue that hoodies are not allowed in the restaurant. My issue is that my partner was asked to change when others weren't and I can guarantee it was because of how he looks. He has tattoos and a hoodie on him probably looks different than a hoodie on others. We felt judged and profiled and I wanted to take my time to write this because it happened, and it wasn't right.

It has taken me over a month to write this review.  I did not want to review while I was emotional or angry.  I don't go into the city often for dinner but it was my daughters birthday and she wanted a special night.  I made reservations for 6 people on 8/15/21.  We arrived and had to wait for the car in front of us to discharge its passengers.  Three scantily-clad women climbed out of the car and immediately had to straighten  their outfits as the process of getting out of the car rearranged some vital body parts in congruence with public decency.  We followed these women into the restaurant and immediately questioned if this was the most appropriate restaurant for family dining.  Four of us went to the bar to wait for my daughter and her friend.   I received a call from my daughter who was outside the restaurant, in tears that she wasn't being allowed in because she didn't meet the dress code.  This was unimaginable to me as we just walked in after 3 provocative, indecently dressed women.  Not to mention that my daughter is an extremely conservative dresser.  Her friend had a collared shirt and pants. She had loose pants, sandals and a shirt.  I spoke with the manager who said her belly is showing and that's not allowed.  The bottom of her shirt met there top of her pants.  It was straight neck, sleeveless, not low cut...very tasteful.  I was completely confused as to how 3 women with plunging necklines, one so low you can see her belly were allowed in but a young teenager with no neckline was stopped at the door.  We were told bare midriffs we're not allowed. Yet, there was a man in the bar with gym shorts, tshirt and baseball hat---which is also not allowed per the website.  Clearly these guidelines are enforced subjectively by the management. How and why my teenage daughter was targeted as not being allowed into the restaurant is a reflection on the management and culture of the company.  We made these reservations in celebration of a special night,  Obviously, the manager preferred having provocatively dressed, scantily clad clientele patron the restaurant as opposed to more modestly dressed young women celebrating with their family.

So we've started on this trek, and the Western Village was\nthe second.\n\nSeems all of the locals think this is the best steakhouse in town - bar none. We started thinking that to be true when the earliest reservation we could get was in three weeks. Western Village is a unique place, part casino, part hotel, and part truck stop. They're owned by the Peppermill so they know their stuff. \n\nThe room is nicely appointed with lighter colors, in upholstered booths arranged around the room. My wife quickly commented that it seems more light and airy than a typical casino steakhouse. Translation - she liked it better. It's right off the casino floor but you can't really tell when seated. \n\nThe staff, including our waiter were a little young, but all very professional. Compared to other neighborhood casino steakhouse we've frequented the menu was pretty high-end. There are a variety of steaks as you'd expect (I had the filet and it was excellent) but also more elaborate dishes such was Beef Wellington and Steak Diane. Of course they have seafood too, my wife had the salmon but didn't seem too impressed. It certainly was good but we weren't bowled over by the food. \n\nThe hook here is the little touches. They bring sorbet between courses, frequently combing off crumbs and refilling water glasses, they come take a picture then present it to you at the end of the meal.  All of those things are kind of special occasion touches you'd get at a higher end place. My wife loved that. \n\nOverall a fun experience, but frankly it's the same as you'd get at a bigger property - experience or price-wise. Definitely worth a go, especially for special occasions. \n\nTip: Sign up for their players club and a week or so later they'll send you some 1/2 off coupons.", "date": "2021-12-06 23:48:59", "user": {"name": "Kevin", "review_count": 127, "yelping_since": "2011-06-27 00:38:54", "elite": "2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 3.53, "fans": 3}}, {"review_id": "8vFznaQIngnDlCLGPfLLBA", "user_id": "zOCsL-y8erCAM-nrCXtpaw", "business_id": "CYKj959PZDjweV-CSpssCg", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "I visited this steak house for a family dinner.

We came to Osteria to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary and we're disappointed by the horrible service. I made our reservation 1.5 weeks ago. I confirmed it on the phone and reminded the individual I spoke with of our anniversary. Upon entering the restaurant there was no greeting, no happy anniversary, which I didn't think anything of until we we're led to our table outside. This table seemed like in afterthought. It was outside right by the entrance gate, not in the greenhouse or in the true outdoor dining area. It was loud and smelled like diesel exhaust from all the cars going by. The view was of Broad Street.\nI asked Grace, the host who led us to our table, to take our photo because it was out anniversary. She begrudgingly agreed, took a few awful photos that she put no effort into, and didn't even have the politeness to say happy anniversary or enjoy your meal. We then requested to sit in the green room, with all the other happy, comfortably seated diners but instead, were led inside. We ordered four pastas, the baked ricotta, a cocktail, and a glass of prosecco. The prosecco and cocktail took 20+ minutes to arrive. I didn't drank one sip and it was room temperature. I did not take another. I voiced my concerns to TJ that this was our anniversary and I was expecting a different experience and he was unapologetic. In fact, rather than use this as an opportunity to improve our experience, he did the opposite. TJ did not check on us once during our meal. He did not bring clean plates or silverware. Another server took pity on us and brought us clean plates for our pastas. The pastas were not timed properly. They all arrived within 5 minutes. While the fazzoletti and the ravioli were delicious, good food is only fully enjoyed by good ambiance and service. Grace and TJ need further instruction and training on customer service.\n1) Grace was unfriendly, unwelcoming, and sat us at a horrible table that was very noisy due to sitting in front of traffic. Not the romantic setting for our anniversary we had hoped for.\n2) We asked to be seated in the green room, where there were empty tables, and were denied\n3) Our server, TJ, did not check on us ONCE during our entire meal. He picked up a plate and when we called to him he did hear or pretended not to hear. We had to ask multiple times for clean plates for dinner after our antipasti.\n4) When I communicated that we were disappointed with the seating and the experience to TJ, he did nothing to improve it... nor did he apologize.\n5) It took 20+ minutes to receive our drinks - my prosecco was room temperature.\n6) We were there for a special occasion, not once was it acknowledged. There was a mind-blowing lack of customer service.\n7) The four pastas were timed so that they all arrived within a few minutes- they didn't even fit on the table.\n\nThe food was good, but the service was despicable.

I was looking forward to a fine dining steak house.  The vibe was nice, beautiful restaurant with a great view of the downtown Nashville skyline from the bar.  We ordered a drink before getting seated, titos/soda water.  When the bill came it was $11.  Totally reasonable for a cocktail.   After we gave our card, the bill came back to add tip & signature & it was $13.67.  I was shocked that $2.67 added on for taxes, not tip.  My husband verified with the manager that the 25% tax rate was in fact correct.  She said yes it was.  I was surprised that it was so high but no problem,  paid it.  \n\nOur server was very friendly.  We ordered a nice dinner, 2 appetizers (wedge salad & cotton candy bacon).  Both were really good.  We ordered 3 entrees (one 10oz filet cooked medium-plus, one 6 Oz wagyu filet cooked medium rare & one scallops) along with 4 side dishes (creme brulee corn, potato agnolti, roasted broccoli & Mac n cheese).  When the entrees & sides arrived the sides were HOT as expected, the entrees were not even warm.  The medium plus steak was cooked medium rare, the scallops were gritty, cool & tasted rather fishy according to my husband. The creme brulee corn was exactly how I imagined it, too sweet for my liking but the others in my party liked it ok.  The potato agnolti was AMAZING, mac n cheese & broccolini were good as well.  The steak toppings were additional costs so we ordered a trio for $10 (chimichurri, truffle butter & truffle bernaiase).  The steaks were so NOT hot that the truffle butter never melted on the steaks.  The chimichurri sauce was delicious. \n\nThe manager that came & spoke to my husband in the bar explained about the taxes & was super friendly.  Even said sorry about the confusion, I will send an appetizer to your table on me.  In a fine dining establishment,  I wouldn't think that I would have to \"remind\" management of their comment so waited to see if the bill reflected her offer, it didn't.   But I'm not one to complain or bicker about $20 but it was just the principal.

When he had about 1/4 left, the waiter asked if he wanted another glass and he said yes. The waiter came back and poured wine in the unfinished wine glass to the original fill line. Essentially only pouring 75% of an already weak pour but charging 100% of the price. I have no problem with waiters not measuring a pour, but at least be on the generous side. \n\nAnd lastly, the woman sitting next to us was quite rude and not minding her own business. Since she was talking loud enough for us to purposely hear, we found out that her father worked in the back. When I ordered my filet mignon \"medium\", she spoke loudly to her date that I ordered it medium and I shouldn't have done that. She goes on to say \"when someone orders the filet more than medium-rare, I just want to yell at them.\" While I'm trying to enjoy my entree, she continues to speak loudly how \"people don't realize that the meat at these types of places are really good so they should only order medium-rare.\" She also continued to get up from her seat and talk to her mom dining at another table. Our whole experience was tarnished by this girl who was commenting on every part of our experience and making rude comments to her partner about how we're not doing it correctly. It's one thing to be mocked by your table neighbor, but for them to be an extension of the staff is pretty embarrassing for the establishment. Especially at a place that's touting itself as fine dining. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't say someone shouldn't try this restaurant.

It had great flavor, but was a bit more runny that typical hummus. I didn't care much for the flatbread it came with, we ended up putting it on the bread they brought to the table than the plain flatbread. We also had the poached pear and fig flatbread.

All the flavors on top went were fantastic and flatbread was the perfect amount of crispy and salty. \n\nFor dinner we shared the green salad special and the assorted wild mushrooms & pecorino polenta.

It had a great earthy flavor from the mushrooms. \n\nThe disappointing part of the evening was that we were celebrating our friend finally getting his US citizenship, and when we made the reservation we put it on the form that we were celebrating that.

Fried calamari is lightly fried in a light batter similar to tempura and it along with the plate sauce was good!\n\nMain course: I have been here twice for lunch and I had the grilled salmon, which was PHENOMENAL and most recently I had the lobster BLT with bourbon apples, watercress and thyme remoulade. It was ok. The sandwich I wouldn't order again. I brought half home. The toasted bread was really toasted. Too crunchy. The lobster was good but even tho I like thyme, I didn't like the flavor of the thyme with the lobster.   Also the watercress looks and tastes like arugula lettuce and it has a bitter bite kinda like arugula. They did have a great portion of lobster on it, so worth the $14.99. I didn't care for the lobster sandwich but that is my personal preference, nothing about the sandwich was wrong or ill prepared so no need to punish the restaurant with less than 5 stars. \n\nDessert: I tried the sampler and everything was delish, especially the creams custard Napoleon. I liked it so well that I ordered the full portion on my most recent trip. I am not a chocolate person but if you are, the chocolate flourless cake cannot be missed. Sooo dense and chocolatey. The third dessert was stl's fave, gooey butter cake.

It was my birthday and I wanted to do something fun with all our kids- while we are all still together- however our kids are 13-23, and they were quite a bit over the demographic age of Mission: Elf. We took pics and \"played\" the basic child games, but it was hardly worth the $20 plus we paid per person and any \"toys\" they had were glued down so there was a lot of frustrated younger kids who couldn't pick up the toys.  I will say we saw the lady cleaning the screens off quite often so they were doing a great job with cleanliness with the Covid going on. \nWe walked through it and it had nice photo ops- but if your kids are over 10 it's basically lame- not really anything super interesting to see and I had wished for ICE!

(ICE was not available as the sculptors couldn't get to the US from foreign countries due to Covid) All the advertisements make Mission: Elf seem fun- and I assumed it was an ICE! Theme- but it's basic touch screen \"find the messed up toy\" take Elfies with various Christmas decor- make virtual cookies but you never see the cookies.. the dance off and the snowball fight are virtual screens that aren't set to pickup adults or adult sized kids. Basically it was meh and at over $20 a person plus $27 a car to park (and walk a 5k basically to get there!) it took forever to find where Mission: Elf was located as the Gaylord had hard to find signage both outside and inside and it was hard to find anyone to ask. There were several other people just wandering around lost.  We did not plan on eating there, but the lines were huge for restaurants and the other venues- pretzels, drinks ,souvenirs had pretty long lines also. We did not stay overnight but the hotel was decorated nicely in the areas. \nI looked for reviews for Mission: ELF & found nothing that wasn't from a news source or Gaylord. I just wanted people to know in advance what it was like, and if you have older kids- teens then it's not really worth the money. I'm hoping ICE!

Up till now the service, food, and atmosphere has been awesome. During that time I have seen both good and bad employees go through the establishment the food has always been excellent except for one fish time. Tonight though, the kitchen staff proved that they could care less about the customers or the food. When we first came in we seen an older couple has just placed their orders and the cook screamed he wasn't going to cook that with a great deal of profanities. Customers were complaining about the loud curse words and several tables complained about not getting all their orders and all we could hear was more profanity from the kitchen.\n\n The next issue of the night was apparently first come first serve is not honored here. I placed an order for a pork steak sandwich and the waitress went to find out if there was any left, which I was fine with. When she asked the cook about it there was more profanity and then the waitress at the counter turned around and sold the last one to someone who literally just walked in after we had been there for a little bit. After that, I ordered the ribeye sandwich and request the saut\u00e9ed onions be diced a little bit even if it is just hitting it with a spatula. The waitress replied with \"I will try\" and we heard the cook cursing her for the request all the way back to our table and he refused to do it. This type of thing continued and delayed our orders and other customers order because of the temper tantrum being thrown in the kitchen. Next as we were finishing our meal, a new server came in and was complaining loudly from the register that she did not like one of the girls she was working with.\n\n In all the times I have been here before, there has never been a visit as crazy as this. I would like to say that our server bless her tried her best to give excellent service even with everything that was happening.  Also the steak sandwich was excellent.

It's a big place with a nice bar, they have plenty of seats and the music is reggae at just a little bit loud of a level for me but not too bad. It definitely was busy.\n\nOur waiter was very nice and the service was prompt. We didn't have to ask for anything more then once and our drinks were filled regularly. \n\nMy wife doesn't do sushi or seafood so she ordered the Vegetable Tempura, and cucumber salad for appetizers and the Chicken Katsu Skewers as main course. I ordered two orders of baked mussels, some different nigiri, and some different rolls. I have to say it's nice to see a place have different rolls. A lot of places in town have almost the same exact menu when it comes to sushi. \n\nMy wife's Vegetable Tempura and Cucumber Salad came out and they were decorated very nicely. The Tempura had great crunch and nice big vegetables. The cucumber salad had nice flavors and the addition of the lemon garnish actually lent some citrus to the dish and made it better. Unfortunately wires must have been crossed cause I only received one order of two mussels. They weren't bad just dry and a little chewy, they didn't remove it from the abductor muscle so it was a little tough removing it. \n\nI started receiving my sushi items. I was disappointed to see that the ordering menu didn't have the two new rolls from Nevada Brining Company on them so I didn't know how to order them. I received my orders of nigiri, a California Deluxe Hand Roll, a Salmon Skin & Octopus Hand Roll, the How We Roll long roll, and the Mr. Blonde. I figured I'll order more if I'm hungry later. The How We Roll was really good, I was very surprised cause I'm not into baked fish but it would be something I would order again. The Hand Rolls were both good and the nigiri as well. Wasn't a huge fan of the Mr. Blonde. My only issue was the rice. The rice had zero flavor, it didn't have that vinegary pop that you expect. It was also a little mushy. I know most people say \"it's just rice\" but honestly rice plays a big part in sushi. If the rice isn't good it changes the taste of the fish. Maybe they were busy and didn't have time to flavor the rice when they cooled it. It was disappointing and honesty stopped me from ordering anything else. \n\nMy wife really enjoyed her Chicken Katsu skewers. They were nicely decorated and came with a salad and some edamame. They were nice and crispy and the edamame was a nice snack with it. She would definitely order it again. \n\nAll in all it wasn't a bad meal, trust me I've had worse sushi places here in town but it wasn't the best. I liked the different rolls and the presentation. My only issue was the rice. I will try them again hopefully when it's not so busy. I'm hoping the rice will be better.

The hostess in the front was kind of confusing because she told me to wait in the waiting area without taking my name for my party??? I ended up asking her to write my name down for my group... Anyways, my party crammed into a 4 person booth and went along with ordering from the AYCE paper menu. AYCE for dinner is ~$23 per person. The ordering process is fairly straight forward, but one will need the menu to get the descriptions of each roll etc as the paper ordering menu only has the names of each dish.\n\nApparently, my party of 5 ordered way too much and the manager was nice enough to notify us that he slashed our order in half in order for us to eat a little before ordering more. Definitely a nice gesture on the manager's part and I thank him for that! I've been to my fair share of AYCE sushi places and this place rocks! The quality of the fish and rolls is amazing. The nigiri (salmon and eel) is perfect. It has fat pieces of fish and small rice underneath it. Just the way I like it! In fact, most of the rolls here have a good rice to fish ratio in my opinion. Don't forget to also make room for dessert! The \"happy ending\" dessert has fried banana with whip cream and ice cream. Super good and a perfect way to end a meal.

For a restaurant experience you can't go wrong here, highly highly suggest coming. It is worth the hype it is given.\n\nWhen I grade restaurants I have strict consistent criteria. 5 stars is the best you can give on Yelp so to receive 5 stars you must be perfect, from beginning to end. I look back on my experience at 5th and Taylor and can't find 1 complaint or something even remotely close.\n\nThe menu is simple, but will change seasonally. They stick with a similar theme and flavor profile for dishes during different times. They have vegetarian, but stick to mostly meats. AND...PRO TIP...almost every entree comes with bottomless mashed potatoes. They are creamy and delicious too!!\n\nI'm a big taster, so we end up ordering lots of things. The sausage biscuits were homemade, with maple flavor on the sausage, dijonaisse sauce, and a sweet pepper jelly. The bacon wrapped quail had a blackberry reduction to go with the barbecue flavor and very tender meat. The crab claws were fresh, amazing lemon flavor, and they gave us about 20 of them!\n\nThe duck breast starts with a tender bite, hint of either gravy or blackberry sauce, and finishes with the salty kick from the prosciutto it's wrapped in. Amazing flavors!! The brussels were some of the best I have had, all tender, cheese and charr on them, and add that to the mushrooms that had a smoky flavor and it was perfect.\n\nWe obviously did dessert, ordered bourbon vanilla ice cream with chocolate cake. They accidentally brought out chocolate and vanilla ice cream, so said not worries it's on us, and brought the cake as well. The cake was AMAZING!! Cooked in the dish it is served in there is fudge on the bottom with walnuts on top and little charred bits of cake around the side. \n\nElizabeth was a great waitress, thorough but not hovering, and the entire atmosphere was fun and welcoming.

(Alcoholic drinks are extra.)\n\nWe were on tight timeline to make the 2pm matinee of the ballet at the Academy (literally next door on Broad, across Locust St).  Staff kept us on schedule without making us feel rushed -- just well attended to.\n\nFirst course: mini-buffet around a tall bar area -- you serve yourself raw bar items such as shrimp and oysters, plus excellent nova/smoked salmon, a couple great salads, and sundry other delicious things.  Second course is ordered from an enticing list of entrees -- some brunch-like, some supper-like.

Both dishes were perfectly prepared and beautifully presented and just the right portion size to leave room for... the scrumptious dessert buffet.

After careful research online I let out a big sigh and booked a reservation for Morimoto. A back story on us is we like great food but at an affordable price so Morimoto being at its price point is something we would've never even thought about it. Firstly, when you walk in the ambience of the restaurant is simply stunning and breathtaking. It's a unique and modern look with slowly changing LED lights that set the mood. I ordered the \"South Pacific\" drink, a calpico soda with pineapple and cilantro from the non-alcoholic menu and it was very light and refreshing! For appetizer, we wanted something unique so we got the wagyu hot stone which is a cook at your table dish in which they put a hot stone in the oven and it comes to you very very hot and you cook it yourself at your table with the instruction of the employee. We had never had Wagyu this buttery soft and delicious and wish we could experience it all over again. I mean just WOW!! We ordered the $90 chef's combination for dinner which comes with sashimi, sushi, and sushi rolls. Initially, we were planning on getting two cause we do enjoy feasting but opted out to only getting one and getting more later if we were still hungry. The flavors were absolutely out of this world and nothing we've experienced before. I don't know how many times we said \"this place is expensive for a reason\" but it was so so worth it and just absolutely melt in your mouth. The portion was also very reasonably sized in which we didn't have to order more afterwards. For dessert, again going on the theme with unique, we ordered the fiery chocolate, that is essentially flourless chocolate cake with meringue, raspberry ice cream, bits of pomegranate encased in a chocolate ball that they light on fire using alcohol. It was so fun and pretty to watch and even more delicious especially the cake. Overall, I would highly recommend this place to everyone to at least openly consider and experience.

Like all chef-ish food, the various courses were full of confusing and mysterious ingredients, yet so delicious that I did not care whatsoever whether I knew what the f*** I was eating.\n\nThe omokase is seven courses; they also brought out a wee little amuse-bouche in between somewhere. The whole experience took about 2 hours -- if you choose to do this meal, just leave plenty of time. Obviously Honey and I passed the evening gazing adoringly at each other. \n\nRather than rhapsodize about every course, I will just deal with the sushi course which was at the very end. It was five pieces of sushi, and they were small and slender in the more traditional old-school style. If you are a nerd and want to learn more about that, I recommend you watch the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi. It is adorable. So the waiter told us to eat the sushi in order from left to right. And we did. The first piece, a tuna which had some sort of intense flavor added to it, was so incredibly good that I burst into tears. I pulled myself together and continued on the flavor journey, and then the last piece, freshwater eel, was again so good that I burst into tears again. \n\nOne note about the sushi: the rice was the absolute best sushi rice I have ever had anywhere. Not too sweet or vinegar-y, gently clinging together in a nice shape but not gummy or sticky, not overcooked even a tiny bit. As I chewed the little morsels, I could feel the texture of each grain of rice in my mouth. Astounding! When I mentioned this to the waitress she smiled and replied that they polish the rice themselves by hand in the kitchen. Which is pretty much the all-time most high-dollar chef-tastic thing I have ever heard.\n\nI was so love-drunk on that food that I can't truly recall whether it would have good handicap access. It should be fine for anyone who's up on two legs with crutches or a walker. Not sure about a wheelchair. It's in Philly near the busy Penns' Landing area so parking will be a bit intense.

I don't know if it switched owners or managers or what. \n\nSpeaking of tiki bar, the doorman asked us a couple times if we wanted to get a drink at the tiki bar rather than wait for the downstairs bar. Seems like they're really trying to push the tiki bar. We said no because we wanted to relax and sit at a table downstairs. \n\nWell it wasn't relaxing downstairs at all. It was so hot down there it felt like I was in a sauna. I was going to complain but it was hard enough getting a waiter to take our drink order. Also there was club music playing so loud I had to scream at my husband for him to hear me. When did this place become a dance club and not a speakeasy? Are they trying to compete with the other speakeasies by making this one different? This just makes people want to go to other places. \n\nOur waiter eventually came over and took our drink order. I ordered the part time fluffer full time lover drink with peanut butter bourbon, graham cracker liquor, coconut, vanilla, cream and egg white. I was expecting it to taste kind of like the with a baseball bat drink that we had before but this drink was much sweeter. Didn't even taste the bourbon much at all, but it had good flavor I enjoyed it. They toasted marshmallows on top too which I liked.\n\nWe wanted a second drink but it took forever for someone to take our order again. We were almost ready to throw cash down and leave. Eventually our waiter that brought out our first drinks comes over to bring us water and asks if we're ok. We said we wanted another drink and he says ok well someone will be over to take our order. What? Wasn't he our waiter? He took our order earlier. He was still waiting on the tables right next to us. We end up giving our order to another girl that comes over and we cash out after our next drink order. Our original \"waiter\" that apparently wasn't supposed to be waiting on us brought those new drinks out to us. Drinks were good but we were ready to leave. \n\nAlso i went to use the bathroom and there was water all over the floor it got my purse wet. Gross. \n\nBottom line drinks are 4 stars but service is 1-2 stars. I'm being generous with the 3 star review really it should be a 2.5 stars. Even the drinks don't seem quite as creative as they used to be. \n\nIt's a shame. Don't know if this is a server issue or management issue but something needs to be fixed. Seems like totally unorganized and lack of communication. I think maybe they are trying to push people in and out as fast as they can to maximize profit.

I've felt every time we've been here in the past two years it's been worse and worse.  I thought it was bad when they ran out of all of the ingredients we wanted before, but last night was the worst.  \n\nThe doormen have always been amazing, but this time we were told there was a five or ten minute wait.  No problem, we've never been able to just get a seat right away.  The doorman kind of made it seem like we shouldn't wait and go somewhere else though...   Two people left, he went down to clear our table and then from the steps below called up to us.  We were talking to another woman who asked us a question and I didn't realize the doorman was calling to us.  Weird...  The doorman always comes back up the steps to escort us down.  Was this guy just lazy? \n\nWe were seated and I never remember music in this place.  I've seen speakers before, but was music every playing?  I don't remember, but this nightclub was loud.  Is it still a speakeasy?  Our Waiter? came up, brought us water, took our drink order and brought us our cocktails.  They were good.  Thankfully!  For the next round, another waiter, who has been there the last few times we were there, brought us a drink menu and disappeared.  We waited for twelve minutes for someone else to come to us.  I looked around and a lot of the staff were dancing.  Even the doorman.  I guess he wasn't lazy, just tired from dancing.  Our waiter? came back to fill the water and I told him we wanted another round.  He said something like \"Someone will be over to take your order\".  What?  Really?  If I didn't just use all of my cash up for dinner, I would have just dropped money and left.  Some woman came up, took our order and I gave her the credit card too to cash out.  So we wouldn't be waiting forever to leave.  Who brings us our drink?  The same Waiter? who took our orders and delivers them...   The same guy taking other peoples orders?  Why did he suddenly stop helping us?  First time in awhile there were no cocktail issues, other than not getting served, but everything else fell apart even more...

Several of the wines were new to my wife and myself, and included wines from several uncommon and interesting regions.\n\nThe big downside for us was the timing of the meal.

This made the entire experience feel rushed, and it felt as if we were on a schedule from beginning to end.\n\nAlso, the amount of food was a good bit less than I would expect from a typical tasting menu.

During the year, the menu changes to reflect the flavors of the four seasons.\n\nYou will get a multi-course meal (we had 15 courses) and may pay extra for wine pairings. I personally found the wine pairings freaking awesome. I don't know much about wines - but all I can say is they just made sense. Tasting the wine with the bites was fun by itself! But don't get carried away - you're going to want to pace yourself on the alcohol (more to come).\n\nAtmosphere:\n\nFirst things first -- Dress comfortable - for real. You will see a couple in their finest dinnerware and another party with Slayer T-shirt's! So wear whatever you feel comfortable with and is respectful of others as you share an intimate space.\n\nFrom the get go you're going to feel really important. You will be met by a staff member who  patiently monitors the awkward silence on the $29.99, two-way radio with optional CIA-issue earpiece. It's a tad awkward as you're kinda just standing on the street corner... but then you're also looking at folks passing by like, \"What up G's I'm at the Catbird, yo!\" But nevertheless you're kinda chilling until they tell you your spot is ready. \n\nAnd just in the moment you're questioning life's decisions - that two-way crackles and you're ushered into a private entrance and into an elevator which takes you to the second floor -- or the Catbird Seat.\n\nYou sit at what I can only describe as an American Hibachi - meaning you sit around a small kitchen in a horseshoe shape. There is plenty of distance between parties and it feels very individualized. The chefs prepare courses of food in front of you and expertly plate the food in beautiful presentations! \n\nThe Food\n\nOk, look... if you're favorite meal is Longhorn steakhouse - this is going to be a drastic departure and somewhat uncomfortable at first. Go in with an open mind and prepare to leave full! \n\nSo let's talk about those 12-15 courses. Prepare to blow your basic-Azz mind. You may not understand what you're eating or fully appreciate the talent it takes to execute the food being presented to you... but like fine art - you will stare at the show and marvel at its beauty while having no idea what the exceptional staff just eloquently explained to you.\n\nThe courses are small bites of exotic and exquisite fare that you looked your mamma in her soul and promised you wouldn't eat. \n\nAnd as you focus on the word, \"sea urchin,\" a chef rambles on about some broth - you also begin praying to the lord of beans and cornbread for forgiveness... because the strange looking bite in front of you is really, really, really good!!\n\nYou're going out of your comfort zone tonight - but you will be glad you did!\n\nService:\n\nDespite the fact you decided to wear your crocks and fancy flannel shirt - this restaurant is swankier than the back room at Golden Coral - and the service is truly exceptional. \n\nWhether you can appreciate what they are explaining or not - the entire crew takes a lot of time to explain every dish and help guests understand what makes it special. You will furrow your brow and nod accordingly while you kick your pinky finger out and dive into a mysterious bite of something that is nothing short of magical. \n\nAnd big guys - don't worry... you will be stuffed when you leave!\n\nBottom Line: throw on some jeans and a decent shirt. Make reservations for some date weeks from now. Then treat that special person in your life to a really awesome culinary experience.\n\nOh yea - and check out Patterson House on the way out the door... it's why you paced yourself on alcohol... it's a feast of exotic cocktails and snacks!!! And by snacks - they have menu items that will make even the most seasoned chicken nugget expert happy!!\n\nCheers :-)", "date": "2021-09-24 03:32:49", "user": {"name": "Andy", "review_count": 59, "yelping_since": "2013-07-04 07:29:36", "elite": "2021", "average_stars": 3.92, "fans": 3}}, {"review_id": "2KcooAyDJ7xxZp6yPuTX_g", "user_id": "Ugza284rLk5vHbSpKTZyMQ", "business_id": "_nqrmx5xKLQyrbmjhwiiuA", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "text": "I will start off by saying that this is a really special restaurant.

While I get this is a summer menu, we really missed variety. \n\nWhen you are talking about nearly $700 for 2 people (with the wine pairing)... you would expect more special protein preparations for that level of pricing. \n\nIt was our anniversary also this time & other than a \"happy anniversary\" at the beginning of the meal, there was nothing else.

You can't preview the menu & you don't exactly know if what they end up preparing will be things you enjoy. \n\nOut of all the courses this time, we only really loved 3 of the dishes.

We have had some decent meals and some not so decent ones throughout the years but as the only Japanese style yakiniku which also happens to be a popular chain in Japan we used to enjoy we always \"wanted\" it to be great and have supported it for years.\n\nSince the pandemic the place is a shell of itself and this was our first and surely will be our last trip to the Callowhill site.\n\nSome highlights:\nAround the bar as you entered the restaurant they seemed to be using this area as an equipment storage area.  I saw a colander sitting in a box as I went by.  Also in another booth which most likely was non operational the employees had left all their clothes, belongings etc.  rather than storing them somewhere away from customers.\n\nThe bathrooms were filthy even by train station standards.  We arrived at opening and the floors were filthy, trash had not been emptied and there were even many toilet seats broken.  Nothing like spending $100 on lunch in a restaurant you are too scared to use the bathrooms in.  Maybe they will get cleaned the mop and a smelly bucket were still sitting near the bathroom but in the customer seating area.\n\nRestaurant cleanliness which has never been great through the years has fallen way off, sticky floors and tables throughout, chipped wood, dirty windows etc.\n\nWe ordered our normally favorite appetizer the Tuna Volcano roll but were told the \"fryers did not start up\".  Our waiter told us they could fry it in oil in a pot and rather than just say no thanks we went for it.  Big mistake, the rice was fried so hard it was inedible and the tuna on top tasted as though it had sat in the fridge too long.\n\nMy wife normally goes just for for the Japanese draft beer they always had on tap.  When we tried to order they alerted us they \"have not had draft beer\" for months.  Perhaps it's time to update the huge picture menu which shows beautiful looking draft beer then on the cover.\n\nThe meat was so so at best but nothing special at all.  The beef tongue which is also a staple of good yakiniku was bland and tough.\n\nAs we tried to leave and use our last 15% coupon their system crashed so we had to leave credit card details which we are still waiting for the charges to show.\n\nAcross the board anywhere you would look it was just super poor and honestly sad.  Even the grill grates the meat are cooked on we're rusty and needed to be replaced.  \n\nIt is impossible to give any positive comments about the entire experience.

The secret to making it even more delicious is making sure that you ask for their three sauces (they'll know what you're talking about). The servings were bigger than expected, so I was happy I could take leftovers home. We also ordered many different vegetables that were generous portions along with the mouth-watering Takoyaki, which is the fried octopus balls! So crispy, the right amount of chewy, and the takoyaki sauce drizzled on top was the best!

And, while it's not cheap, the food you get is largely worth the cost.  Where they get you is on alcohol (which is a little overpriced) and on all the little toppers and accessories for your steak (which are hideously overpriced).\n\nI got the grass fed Delmonico (Ribeye), cooked rare.  First of all, it's one of the uh...\"rare\" steaks that  I've gotten that is actually cooked this way.  Second of all it was good, but not great.  I'm not a steak expert, but after reading 10-12 paragraphs about their steak process...I was just expecting more.  Despite all their verbiage about aggressively cutting away fat, this was a pretty fat ribeye.  I'm the type of person/weirdo that enjoys eating chunks of pure fat on his ribeye and...I left a lot of chunks of fat on the plate.\n\nI love that the steak also comes with everything.  Too many restaurants now serve everything ala cart, and charge you for every little side. The steak here came with soup and salad.  When the steak comes out, it's served with a loaded baked potato and the veggie of the day.  (it was green beans for us)  Everything was good, except for the potato (which wasn't bad, it was fine, just nothing special).  Save room in your stomach for everything else!\n\nAfterwards, we went to the \"dessert room\".  In my head I always thought this was like...a walk-in cooler where you point at the dessert you want.  I could not have been more wrong!\n\nThe Dessert Room is an entirely different restaurant and, in my opinion, a much better one that the steakhouse.  The ambiance here is incredible.  Every table is encased in it's own isolating structure, and they seem to go on forever, like some kind of low-lit labyrinth.  Some of them are apparently RED WOOD (yes, those Redwoods)  wine casks...which I didn't know were a thing.  How delightfully opulent!  I'm not big into dessert, but I loved the offerings on the dessert menu.  Everything was unique and made from scratch.\n\nThe service is very good, but very different that most restaurants.  They will make you feel like you're a mob boss, no matter who you are.  If you're into that, you'll love it!\n\nWill I be back?  Probably not.\n\nAm I glad I finally made it?  Hell yes!\n\nShould you go?  Depends.  If you're into desserts...this will probably be the best place you've ever been to!

It took me some time because I am in mourning.  The Bern's I knew and loved so much has truly changed.\n\nFour of us went for dinner, a special occasion, after landing a reservation which required a call 90 days in advance.  90 days.   We arrived early and offered to give up our hard-won table for some seats in the bar because we love the bar.   We were told no.  Absolutely not.   No?  No!   I had never heard that word before at Bern's, which always did whatever it could to make its diners happy, right down to finding okra somewhere when I mentioned how much I love it.   That \"no\" created a ripple in the Matrix.\n\nSo....we found ourselves in the front dining room (not our favorite dining room) with a nice but less experienced Captain.   We ordered drinks and the caviar tasting to get things going, followed by wine and a variety of steaks.  \n\nThe Caviar tasting options were quite good, making the tasting itself a true value, but I missed the Bern's butters...long gone now with Bern himself.  We  had to ask for more toasts, which took a bit of time to arrive.  Our drinks arrived sporactically as well.  \n\nWe moved somewhat clumsily through the soup and salad courses.  The salads are still served with wonderful housemade dressings including French, something I don't come across often.  You can no longer choose between salads.  House is it.  Anything else is extra.  \n\nThe days of soup choices are also long gone.  French onion is what you get.   I opted for the vichysoisse even though I had to pay extra for something that used to be part of the meal.  I love Bern's vichysoisse and as good as the french onion soup may be, the vichysoisse wins with its caviar and truffle oil topping and its housemade chips.   \n\nThe moment when my love affair with Bern's changed arrived with the steaks.  Bern's always made a great steak, served on a sizzling platter, with butter still melting on top if you so desired.  Alongside the steak, crispy onion strings, a vegetable grown on Bern's farm and amaretto carrots.  Always amaretto carrots.  Until this night.   Our Captain said they were no longer serving them.\n\nMy steak was very good, but no Bern's great.  It was closer to medium than medium rare.  No butter once again.  I received a baked potato with toppings on the side.  The fantastic onion strings were there, a few (4-5) green beans but no amaretto carrots.  No carrots?   How could there be no amaretto carrots?   They are, make that were, a Bern's signature.\n\nThe fresh fish tanks are gone.  The soup and salad courses are set. No choices.  The little extras are no more.  The service isn't quite as precise.  Even the wine cellar feels a little lost.  I chalk so much of this up to the pandemic.  And yet, it was the missing carrots that caused me to pause.\n\nI know that restaurants have to evolve with time.  It just feels as if Bern's is eliminating rather than evolving.   It made me sad to sit in Berns with so many of the things I loved about it now gone or an pricey upcharge.   I had to spend some time reconciling this.   Bern's still offers you a very good meal for a very good price in an eccletic environment typically served by a well-trained efficient staff.   It is far better option than any steakhouse chain in America.   I just mourn the loss of the good old days when it didn't say \"no\" and you were offered you so much more, including those distinctive perfect-with-steak amaretto carrots.", "date": "2021-12-23 03:36:53", "user": {"name": "Katherine", "review_count": 103, "yelping_since": "2011-12-26 02:41:41", "elite": "2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 3.72, "fans": 4}}, {"review_id": "UnX3JpoQJLBFTrFT-_1HPQ", "user_id": "m-dorx_bFnzr0hd0Lr1EDg", "business_id": "dsfRniRgfbDjC8os848B6A", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This is a staple in Tampa.

I have been wanting to try Downtown Kitchen + Cocktails since I moved to Tucson a month ago, and the first and only visit was pretty terrible.\n\nWe were first half-heartily greeted by the hostess that seemed as if she had no desire to be there that night.  She took us to two different tables (we politely requested to sit elsewhere, which she obliged), sat us down along with the menus and sauntered off without saying a word.  The pleasant ambiance we expected wasn't there. We did not feel welcome. \n\nI was tempted to leave until our server greeted us.  She was cheery, helpful, funny and a pleasure to have.  We ordered a couple cocktails, and four appetizers to get things started. Because of the sheer amount of apps, we decided to split an entree and dessert.\n\nThe cocktails came first.  The special that came along with the World Travels event (this time was Panama) was actually quite good, and the best part of the meal.  I ordered an old fashioned, which had all of the right components.  Unfortunately, they use crushed ice for their cocktails, so within minutes the alcohol and flavor starts to dilute. \n\nThe first round of appetizers arrived.  I actually enjoyed the Caesar salad, which had really good flavor and was interesting with the leaves unchopped. However, I didn't quite appreciate paying $4 extra for fresh anchovies, and receiving 2 slivers. \n\nThe ceviche is horrible. The squid and octopus were very rubbery, shrimp overcooked and fish was well done as well (ceviche shouldn't have cooked seafood, yet all of this was steamed).  The sauce was fairly decent, and we dipped our bread in it as an afterthought.  Stay away from this.\n\nThe next round of appetizers came.  First was a cheesy ciabatta.  The flavor was okay, and ranked third on the list in terms of appetizing.  However, the calamari is absolutely horrible in its totality.  The calamari on its own is good, but the roasted peanuts with fresh mango really draw away from the essence of the dish. I tried hard to like this due to the unique nature... I just found it quite pretentious and unnecessary.\n\nOur entree came out.  It was the final night of the Panama event, and this was their last piece of the fish.  Unfortunately, it had been cooked far too long, was dense, dry and lacking texture.  We had a few bites before deciding to cancel the dessert (which we already paid for in the pre-fix) and leave.\n\nI was grateful they removed the old fashioned from the bill, and tipped our fantastic server accordingly.  None of this was the service's fault.  However, due to the way their cocktails are made (server agreed that they should use balls of ice for their cocktails), and the quality of the food, I will not return, nor recommend this place to any of my foodie friends.\n\nEdit: My girlfriend did get sick moments after we left, though it had faded by the late morning the following day. I felt tightness in my chest, which I would attribute to the seafood.  Most likely cause is the fish they served (which was the last for that World Tour event) should not have been cooked and given to customers.

The beef sausages and beef skewer were kind of gamey/old tasting, especially as they got cold, so not the best meat quality. Chicken was just grilled breast, nothing special, not bad. Gyro meat was actually good (I would get it again by itself). Tzatziki was also very good, they don't bring enough with the platter, ordered more to go (to finish all that meat later ) which was 3$ extra. \n\nThe bread was EXCELLENT, however they did not bring enough for the huge amount of meat. Way too much meat for such little bread. Asked for more, but they were out. Any kind of bread would have been good to finish the meat (later since we took most of it home). So again, for the price, things like bread and tzatziki sauce should be plentiful. \n\nBosnian coffee is very good (similar to Turkish/Arabic but with less cardamom flavor)\n\nIn summary, I prefer quality over quantity and would come back to try individual plates (like goulash and gyros), but do not recommend the large grilled platters for just two people.

Chef Alisah's serves delicious Bosnian food! We have never had Bosnian food before and chose several different items to share.\n\nWe first got the Bosnian soda, Cockta (1.5 L) it tastes like a delectable herbal Coke. Then we got one of the appetizers: Bosnian Style Tzatziki and Ajvar (Vegetable Spread). The Tzatziki sauce was super good and tasted very fresh and light. It was smooth and we loved the taste and texture. It was also our first time trying Ajvar, which was a sweet and flavorful spread. After trying it, we really wanted to learn to make it ourselves because it was that good! These two sauces tasted perfect with the bread that was served alongside it! \n\nWe ordered the 2 person Surprise Platter (we were a group of three and wanted to order another dish to try too and also ordered the Cabbage dish.) And wow. We can see why this dish was called the surprise platter. At first the cabbage salad (perfectly dressed with the right amount of sour) came out. Right after that the Surprise Platter came out. We couldn't help but exclaim with surprise by the gigantic size of that thing! WOW! It came with broccoli/carrots with cheese, kebab, chicken, gyro with Tzatziki sauce, beef sausages, and chicken sausages. It was one of the best things I have had in a while. Everything on that platter was delicious. The beef sausages were delicious and tasted great with the bread served. The chicken was moist and perfectly seasoned. Best of all was the kebab! We thought we could soldier through and finish the entire thing but there was so much food we had to take more than half of it home! (Yum! Leftovers!)\n\nThe Cabbage dish was also super delicious! When it came out, the delightful smell of the dish captivated us! The rice was really good but a bit salty. The cabbage tasted buttery soft and melted in the mouth. Combined, the dish was perfect. It left us wanting more!\n\nWe loved the food here so much that we ordered the baklava to-go to eat later at home since we were too stuffed to eat anything else at the moment. We went home and tried the baklava and it was just the perfect amount of sweet and syrupy. One of the better baklavas that I've had. \n\nThe server was awesome and very sweet and the owner even came out to see how we were doing. The service was amazing and we would come back to this place just for that! \n\nIf I'm ever near Tucson, I will definitely be returning here to try more of their dishes!!!", "date": "2021-05-12 00:17:20", "user": {"name": "Michelle", "review_count": 30, "yelping_since": "2014-06-18 19:23:23", "elite": "2021", "average_stars": 4.27, "fans": 1}}, {"review_id": "dkibvQTggl-etZazjNQTfw", "user_id": "28czGJuEAphyc_Vw8cJN6A", "business_id": "Bq0CQcwk5R8yhm-MGfHxCA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Spectacular food.

Because I could not leave the car, I sent him back in the restaurant and told him that if the manager did not make this right that I wanted a refund. Rather than the manager throw a couple more chicken tenders in the box so that the value makes sense paying $16, the manager refunded our order. I would think that adding a couple small pieces of tenders to the box would have been more reasonable than losing a customer but they obviously do not care about customers!! I would like to give a shout out to the nice young man that answered the phone and took my order.

Sweet Freedom is a WONDERFUL option.  It is not a typical bakery; it is made for people with dietary and medical food restrictions, most of them kids.  Despite the restrictions, unlike some other reviewers, I still find the baked good delicious (though small and pricey.)  We have also ordered their birthday cake in the past.  However: I'm writing this critical review because I want to see Sweet Freedom to succeed.  I was recently at the Bryn Mawr location and treated very rudely by the young person at the register, who I believe may have been one of the pastry chefs.  I don't know, and I don't want to get any one person in trouble. I do hope they get this message and change their attitude here on out.  Sweet Freedom is not close to me; it is a hike to come to you.  I am a freelancer, and Sweet Freedom is expensive for me.  My child has been to the ER for anaphylaxis; we take their safety and cross-contamination very seriously.  These three factors make trips to Sweet Freedom extremely rare, costly, and special.  This young person came very close to ruining what is a major event in my life:  to treat my child to specialty items they can't easily get.  I have worked in customer service for decades, and I know firsthand there is never an excuse for rudeness or a condescending attitude.  This person's unsolicited hostility and entitlement were upsetting to me.  I do not know the next time I will willingly return.  The bakery itself is delightful; though costly, the sweets are moist, inventive, delicious, and best of all safe.  I enjoy the atmosphere as well.  However, no business can endure with rude customer service.  In past years I worked in many stores in the same location as your bakery, and I full well know the spectrum of what is acceptable and civil versus what is downright rude.

I feel kind of horrible saying bad things about a place. It's not like me. I think I gave this place a good shot though. I got a variety of things on 3 different occasions. First, I need to say something that a lot of reviews about this place doesn't say. The service is great. I have never had a problem with service. I've always had a smiling, patient and kind person helping me. No complaints there at all!\n\nMy issue with this place is the food items. On visit number 1 I got a cookie and a cranberry crumble bar type thing. The cranberry thing was really really sweet, had a ton of flavor and was really yummy. I'm not complaining about it at all! The cookie on the other hand (chocolate chip) was kind of bland and had a strange aftertaste. I ate it anyway thinking maybe it was from yesterday and not everything can be amazing. \n\nVisit number 2 was a second kind of cookie, I went with the chocolate chocolate chip (or double chocolate - I forget the name) and an apple cider donut. The cookie tasted exactly the same as the first so I thought..ok maybe it's just the cookies. Moving on! But then the donut had the same kind of strange aftertaste. I noticed that the outside of the donut was good because it was basically just sugar and cinnamon, but the consistency of the donut was dry and again that aftertaste that I just can't put my finger on...\n\nVisit number 3. I went with a mint chocolate brownie and a different type of donut. The person who helped me said that she thought it was a jelly filled donut, but she wasn't certain. I was seriously craving that brownie so a few steps out of the store I took a big bite of it. The flavors were mostly there. A nice bite of chocolate and a hint of mint, but the brownie was kind of dry and crumbly and again that aftertaste was lurking. It wasn't so strong this time, but I definitely got it. I waited until the next day with the donut thinking it would still be fine since it was sealed in plastic wrap. Instead of biting into it I decided to rip it in half so I could get to that sweet sweet jelly filling. I was instantly disappointed when I was greeted with what looked like a thick white pasty cream. Boston cream maybe? Not at all. I took a bite of the inside with the donut and the frosting on top thinking I should give this donut all I had and just go for it. Hard no. I actually spit it out and threw the rest away. The cream in the middle and the frosting on top were basically just thick creamy sugar with no flavor and the donut had that aftertaste thing going on times 1,000. \n\nI tried and then I tried and I tried again.

There is a LOT of food that comes with the tasting menu and you will want to eat every single plate and clear it all before the next plate is set down. Don't do that.

It was founded by head chef Michael Solomonov and his business partner Steven Cook. Solomonov was born in G'nei Yehuda, Israel and raised in Pittsburgh. At the age of 18, he returned to Israel with no Hebrew language skills, taking the only job he could get -working in a bakery- and his culinary career was born. At Zahav (Hebrew for \"gold\"), Solomonov weaves together the culinary traditions of immigrants to Israel from all over the world with the ancient foodways of Arabia and the Levant. The cooking at Zahav comes from a deep well of Israeli hospitality. \n\nMy wife and I ate at Zahav in April 2015 during our 4-day sightseeing trip to Philadelphia. Zahav is one of Philadelphia's most popular restaurants. It is so popular that I was only able to get a reservation at 9PM on a Sunday night. After scanning the menu, we decided to order the 'Taste or Zahav' experience where you get to try a little bit of everything. Up first was the Salatim course: six different small plates of Israeli vegetable salads (lots of pickled/marinated veggies). Then we had delicious Laffa bread with hummus. The Mezze course consisted of crispy Haloumi, house-smoked sable, fried fingerling potatoes and crispy chicken. For entrees, I had the Duck Kebab and my wife had the Chicken Shishlik. For dessert, I had the Israeli Ice Cream Sandwich and my wife had the Pear Sorbet. This was easily one of the best dining experiences we ever had!

We ordered our favorites and while our interactions with our waiter were a bit odd, they weren't inhospitable to start.  We ordered a variety of dishes and when I was delivered my A5 steak, it was completely grey (except for one slice that was mauve) and I had ordered it med rare. I had been a waitress for a decade and my husband is a chef and I had never in my life sent a steak back. But, after trying a bite- I couldn't justify eating a $128 steak that had been cooked incorrectly. The expert at the table confirmed and I waited about 10 minutes for our server to check in. When I flagged him down, I was shocked to find that he argued with me about my steak. He told me A5 is \"always grey\" and if I wanted for it to be pink in the center, I needed to order it rare. He completely blamed me for ordering incorrectly- asking \"have you ever had waygu before?\" Instead of trying to assuage my discomfort in asking for the problem to be fixed in the first place--- honestly, this is a steak house and the steaks are cut before they are sent out, this shouldn't have even made it out of the kitchen.  Fortunately a manager walked by and inquired and immediately said she was sorry and that it was definitely over cooked. So, she brought the plate back and it was replaced at the right temp...which should be a guarantee for the cut and price point at one of Nashville's premiere steak houses.\n\nOverall, we left our meal having spent $480 feeling awful.  We were reprimanded by our server, waited a very long time to eat and made to feel like unreasonable and demanding jerks- which we really aren't.  This has officially been crossed off the list of  places to dine and recommend, perhaps we will enjoy the great bar balcony in the future to enjoy the wonderful wine list and cocktails but we'll stick to other steak houses in town for waygu.", "date": "2021-11-25 04:17:06", "user": {"name": "S", "review_count": 32, "yelping_since": "2013-12-19 06:06:18", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.0, "fans": 2}}, {"review_id": "cpn5U03VncLw_7U3EsQeJA", "user_id": "FHoiEZMhfqRqxXMl7yvsNA", "business_id": "I-nrEtjboBLoEvGiSAcmvw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I absolutely loved this place!

We had recently moved to Idaho Falls, but decided to revisit restaurants we had enjoyed in the past. We tended to come to Chandlers for special occasions and looked forward to this experience.\n\nAs always we told our server that we liked to dine, and space out the meal so that we could talk and share the special time. David agreed that would be fine, and engaged us in conversation about Idaho Falls, as he had lived near Driggs.\n\nWe ordered oysters, clams, and escargot and a nice bottle of wine recommended by the sommelier. We asked they be brought out separately and over time. We decided that was enough, maybe even for the entire meal, as we weren't that hungry; we just wanted to enjoy the ambience.\n\nWe had mentioned ordering the halibut, but realized we should wait to see how we felt after the appetizers. David pointed out that the halibut often sold out, and that if we wanted it, we should order it immediately.\n\nWe asked if it could be prepared under-cooked, as we tended toward sashimis and rare fish. He said sure, so we said ok to one order that we would split.\n\nWe enjoyed the oysters, and clams, and the wine, but by the time they brought out the escargot, we realized we really did not want the halibut.\n\nWe ordered a second bottle of wine, but asked that the halibut be released to another table, given it tended to sell out.\n\nWe had just started the escargot, but the response was, \"I've already submitted the order. If you wish, I can bring it out in a box and you can take it with you.\"\n\nThat felt extremely uncomfortable, especially for a fine dining establishment. It would be close to 30 minutes before we would be ready to accept the entree. Certainly the halibut was still in it's natural form and could be given to another? Yet the server was adamant that we had made the order (at his urging) and that we couldn't rescind it now.\n\nAlso, he was aware that we were in a hotel and traveling and that a \"take home\" of the halibut would be a useless gesture.\n\nSo, we sighed, and said, ok, fine, but please don't have them cook it yet, as we need a little time to digest... thus it was at least 30 minutes before the halibut was served.\n\nWe enjoyed the escargot and held off on the wine so as to have some with the halibut. We were relieved we'd only ordered one to split.\n\nWhen it did arrive, we were stunned. It was a nice presentation, but it was nigh on inedible for us. The asparagus was gigantic and woody, but the real problem was the fish itself. It was extremely overcooked, tough, and also lukewarm.\n\nIt had apparently been prepared long before, and had sat somewhere waiting to be presented to us. When we mentioned this, and reminding that it should be under-cooked for us, the response was that the chef works to prepare the dishes the way they should be enjoyed, implying that the dish was as it \"should be\".\n\nWe noted that we no longer had friendly banter, and that as we chewed the badly prepared dish, we also now had to pour our own wine.\n\nThe appetizers and wine were fantastic, but this incident ruined the evening that we had hoped would be memorable.\n\nI reviewed Chandler's in 2019 about our 40th anniversary dinner with them. It was a wonderful evening, but I noted that I gave them only 4 stars because \"There was just something a tiny bit missing to make the anniversary dinner perfect\".\n\nIn hindsight, I now know what that was - the subtle attitude of the server and the restaurant that we were there for their benefit, not that they were there for ours, especially given we were paying over $200 for a dinner for two on every visit.\n\nVery disappointing.", "date": "2021-11-15 21:28:22", "user": {"name": "Dan", "review_count": 396, "yelping_since": "2013-01-31 17:35:44", "elite": "2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 3.97, "fans": 17}}, {"review_id": "zPy-n4EA3MvZgU-WiJ1_Xg", "user_id": "uT5_brdnxa2NWJskq9TZmw", "business_id": "6djwQL1FOoe0SZONQHjhrw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "The food, service and ambiance were just amazing.

Greeted by the hostess, we were wished a \"Happy Anniversary\" immediately, and soon seated in a cozy booth, topped with fresh white linen and bedecked with rose petals (yeah, for real) and glittery tiny hearts and confetti.  We looked at each other, and thought that, just maybe, I was too hasty in telling the reservation system that we were celebrating our anniversary.\n Every staff member who passed our table wished us a Happy Anniversary-- The busboy, Ma\u00eetre D', waiters & waitresses, food runners, and more. Never-the-less, the dinner was terrific. My Lillet on the rocks with a slice of orange was served perfectly, and generous. Our appetizer-- Lobster & Crab Cakes served with a corn garnish were overly hot and spicy, New Orleans style. Luckily, we like it hot, but these should have come with a warning-- or a fire extinguisher-- as to the volatility.

The 14 oz NY strip steak, mashed potatoes and spinach lacked seasoning and the steak was a bit tough and hard to get through. My grandson's kids filet was $17 and didn't come with any sides.

The manager removed the steaks after our feedback that night (stating that they were very busy for restaurant week) and I made a f/u call to the restaurant to try and understand what happened that night because I was thinking about giving them another try outside of restaurant week- and the manager told me that he already corrected the problem in \"real time\" that night.

This year we thought to change things up which involved calling every Steakhouse/Seafood place in downtown Indy. We were impressed by the organization, set menu and everything Oceanaire laid out for us, so we went with them. We had to prepay $89 pp one month before (25people x $89 $2,225). Oceanaire obviously knew we were coming and came up with a preset menu, so what could go wrong...right?\n\nOur reservation was at 5:15 on a Saturday, we arrived about 10 mins early, they were still getting a few things ready - not a big deal at all, we will stay out of your way. There were MAYBE two other tables with guests there at this time.\n\nWe had three tables in their private room to preface. So we of course start by ordering drinks - great. Well two tables received their drinks 15- 20 mins in, ok fine, again no guests were there besides us really. The third table didn't receive their drinks until ONE HOUR IN. Again, pretty much just us there still at this point. We asked our waitress multiple times and she said they are coming. So yeah an hour for our first drinks meanwhile the other two tables have already finished their first drinks at this point and were getting appetizers.\n\nSo very poor service to start off. Then they take all of our orders - completely disregarded half of one of the tables. We had to flag down the waitress again and let her know she forgot about 6 of our orders.\n\nMind you we paid ahead of time and have a set menu, so there isn't really anything they shouldn't have been prepared for. Also we were down 4 people due to sickness so 21 total. Reservation started at 5:15, we did not get all of our entrees until about 8:15....THREE HOURS to eat!!! With a preselected menu.\n\nOh, salmon came our raw (see pic), several of the entrees were wrong. We didn't leave until about 9:30pm. Absolutely ridiculous. The waitress took about 30-45 minutes for our checks that we stated out how we would be doing them at the beginning to avoid confusion at the end. So on top of our prepaid amount we also were charged 18% gratuity on all of our drinks we ordered for the poor service. \n\nAt one point I asked for a glass for wine (not for wine, a glass for wine since we had a bottle at the table) the waitress brought me my glass then wine and I told her I didn't order that and she took it back and still charged us.\n\nWe expressed our disappointment to the manager on duty and he said they would reach out Monday. Someone did reach out on Monday and had no idea what went on and said she would call back after she talked to the manager and never called back. So here we are, having to provide the feedback here.\n\nAs for the 4 that couldn't make it, they said they would make their entrees to go, please see pictures for a very sad $89 take out meal. One of the filets was raw, one was not filet it was like a skirt steak lol and they put my cheesecake in the same container so everything was coated in cheesecake and forgot our soups too.\n\nSo this restaurant, we easily dropped $4k+ that night and nothing to show for it.

Its something so small that made us feel so special. The menu has a pretty concise list of seafood... because its literally flown in daily. Its that fresh. I did have questions for our server because I haven't heard of several of them. I decided to order the monkfish.\n\nBut first for a drink, I ordered a spiced pear mule. If you like Moscow mules, with a hint of cinnamon and pear flavor, you will love this. They also use high quality vodka (i believe it was grey goose)\n\nOur food then came. The monkfish came with oysters, potato wedges, and kale as well. This was by far the BEST seafood dish I have ever had. You could tell it was fresh. It had a sweet, yet savory flavor. The oysters were on point, and the tomato broth that is in the bowl had a great flavor that complimented the entire dish. Usually I always only eat half of my dish when I go out, but I couldn't stop eating lol. To the chefs, seriously you are amazing and the best in my book.\n\nIf you come in for anniversaries, you are served complimentary baked Alaska, which is basically a brownie with strawberry ice cream and whipped cream, then set on fire with 151. Once again, the flavor was amazing and we were super impressed with the presentation.\n\nThe service was also on point. Our waters were always full by the servers walking around with pitchers. Our main server Brian was also amazing. He described the food so well and was super friendly. He checked on us periodically, but not too much.\n\nThis place definitely is expensive, but for the quality, it is 100% worth it.

He had to go over the menu several times as we had people ordering off the main menu as well. He kept the evening flowing very smoothly. We ordered quite a selection, most of it off the Devour menu and everything from the bread through to dessert was excellent! Several of us ordered the oysters and I can recommend the Plymouth Champagne oysters. There are many varieties to choose from. I had the calamari as my appetizer and  I loved it. Not overly fried and I love the tentacles so always happy to see those. I had the Swordfish with risotto, asparagus and mushrooms. Amazing! The Sticky toffee pudding  was similar to a bread pudding and very rich. The Strawberry Fields drink was a great match for this meal. \nOthers ordered the Chicken Fried Lobster, Lobster Mac & Cheese, the 22oz. steak among others.\nLastly, there were a couple of orders of the Baked Alaska.

But, today was the last straw. I order my food way ahead of time and my SO goes to pick it up. He still waited an hour in the parking lot for it. Okay, fine I guess cause their wait times have always been that long when dining in lately. Brings home the food, and oh the mess unfolds. The bibimbap is missing the rice and the sauce. I called the restaurant to see how they could remedy it, and the person that picked up wasn't even sure what went into the bibimbap. She transferred the phone to another girl, who then also wasn't sure if the dish had rice or sauce and asked if I should be having rice. In my head, I was like the Korean word for \"rice\" is LITERALLY in the dish name, and yes, comes with sauce. Just try to tell this Korean it doesn't. I didn't pay all this money to just have veggies and a fried egg. I just calmly said, yes...it should. She then was like whatever, you can come pick it up. At that point, I'm like y'know what, I'll just heat up my own damn rice and make my own damn sauce cause guess that really is what I gotta do from now on instead of ordering from this place.

We were supposed to go to another Korean restaurant near Takamatsu that was recommended to us, but we mistakenly went into Takamatsu instead. Takamatsu had the WORST Korean food I've ever tasted. Watery marinade and undermarinating the beef made the Bulgogi actually bland and flavorless except for the vague flavor of soy sauce and lots of sugar. There was no attempt to achieve balance between sweet and savory in their barbecue marinades as both the Bulgogi (beef) and Daeji-Bulgogi (spicy pork) were disgustingly sweet even though we grilled them at the table, which should have carmelized some of the sugar. The kimchi was one-dimensional, tasting mostly of salt and red pepper due to their skimping on the fresh garlic and fresh ginger. The kimchi was just raw tasting cabbage soaked in salt and red pepper, because it had not been allowed to sit long enough to actually ferment and develop flavor (in addition to the missing flavors of fresh garlic and fresh ginger). It was bizarre to get such badly done, tasteless, un-Korean dishes in a place where so many Koreans were working as managers & servers in the front of the house. \n\nAlso, the table was clammy and sticky when we sat down, which means it was not cleaned very well and that's disturbing given the need for cleaning well for COVID-19 safety.

They also took way too long to bring the check and the whole time the pile of our dishes sat in front of us. \n\nThe meal was a total waste of money as we could have had a more authentic Korean meal from a grocery store frozen food section.

To be honest, the oldies music also drew me in this particular night. We sat outside near the beautiful patio area. I ordered a strawberry basil cocktail which was pretty strong. We ordered two appetizers, the fried calamari and the fresh steamed clams. For our entrees we both got the tomahawk steak, for my side I got spaghetti and marinara (unfortunately the photo I took came out super blurry and I made a rookie mistake of not taking multiple photos to choose from...ugh!). As far as appetizers go, the fried calamari was slight on the fishy side but the chipotle aioli was really good...it also came with the tentacles which most people don't like but it's my favorite part. The fresh steam clams was my favorite thing out of the whole dinner! When it first came out my jaws dropped because I could not believe how big these clams were(they seem to be quahog clams), the broth was perfect for me when it came to seasoning, it was not salty like most places tend to make it. I was also surprised by their garlic bread that came with the clams. The flavor was garlicky and not bitter, the bread was not too dry or overly toasted. Moving on to the tomahawk steak, it was cooked to perfection(I got mine medium rare), the seasoning was just salt and pepper(I have to give it to them for not overly making anything too salty). The side of spaghetti and marinara was also good too, normally I'm not the biggest fan of marinara sauce because it's usually too watery and bland but this one had actual depth, it felt like I was eating hearty bolognese sauce without the meat. The salad that came with it was a standard style dinner salad with your choice of dressing and I chose balsamic vinaigrette which I wasn't super fond of(too sweet for me taste buds).\nBy the way, the service was great and the waiter was amazing. So when they first brought out the steak the waiter also brought a glass of red wine to me and I was about to say we did not order a glass of wine but the waiter said this wine goes really well with the steak and that it was on him.

I absolutely loved it! It was tasty and delicious and I could not believe the whole thing was vegan.\n\nA couple of days ago, my husband had asked me about this place and I excitedly made reservations for our Friday night dinner. When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by a gracious host and seated at a table.  We started with some cocktails.  He had the mule and I ordered the hibiscus mojito.  We enjoyed our cocktails but I don't care too much for an abundance of sweet things so I switched to a glass of Cabernet for our meal.\n\nWe ordered some fried beets and jackfruit tinga sopes to start.  Both were delicious but the jackfruit tinga sopes were so different, yet very flavorful and tasty!  I kind of wished they had it as a main dish.  \n\nFor my main dish, I ordered the vegan meatloaf.  Very flavorful, very tasty, and came in very generous serving portion.  My husband had the jambalaya.  He said he was hoping for a spicier dish but otherwise, it tasted good.  We decided to get another round of drinks and shared the dark chocolate avocado mousse.  I loved the mousse.  My husband was indifferent but said the meringue was quite delicious.\n\nService was wonderful as usual.

All the different flavors and textures came together like a symphony in your mouth. The next best dish was the arnabeet mekle (perfectly seasoned crispy roasted cauliflower). We demolished that one. We also ordered the hummus and the baba ganoush that were both very good but did not exceed expectations. The turmeric rice was good although the portion was a little skimpy. My friends also spoke really highly of the yakneh (seafood stew) and the kafta kebab (ground beef). They also have a fun and interesting cocktail list! I started with \"the throne of beauty\" as recommended by our waiter, which was boozy and tasty, with mezcal and pineapple. The even more intriguing cocktail was \"the poet\" with gin, cucumber, aquafaba, and a sprinkling of za'atar. Overall, we had a really lovely time at Suraya. It's not somewhere you would go everyday because of the prices, but I think the quality is well worth the price. We ended up spending $70 per person (including tax and tip) for all the food we wanted (possibly too much? haha) plus one cocktail each. I'd especially love to return for brunch sometime so I can try the Lebanese chai that others on here have raved about.", "date": "2022-01-03 15:28:59", "user": {"name": "Lauren", "review_count": 247, "yelping_since": "2015-06-26 14:03:34", "elite": "2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.24, "fans": 9}}, {"review_id": "friEjbanVxCIXQmIa_MeJA", "user_id": "PKbSvmteIMxq_ccnnxe-sA", "business_id": "vUrTGX_7HxqeoQ_6QCVz6g", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "By far the best restaurant experience i've ever had.

Typically I avoid them because they tend to be thick, syrupy sweet, and can be quite \"boozy\" - however, Hotel Tango's versions have a pleasant balance between fruit, spirit, and sweetness. So there's enough fruit essence, sweetness, and alcohol without any of the components being too offensive.\nFood was awesome: charcuterie board & pizza were both phenomenal (kudos to the kitchen team)\n\nWe even got to see the staff's professionalism in action. One customer (not in our group) was intoxicated - and the bar staff let him know and proceed to stop serving him, per their policy.

My Dad lives in a condo with a concierge service that receives mail/packages (among other things). Last weekend, I asked my Dad if he had received the vodka I ordered and found out that he never had. I couldn't find the link to the company that shipped the vodka so I reached out to Hotel Tango's customer support. On Monday, I received a message from their customer support telling me that the company that shipped the vodka attempted to deliver it 3 times and I now had two options: pay $25 to reship the vodka or pay $20 to return the vodka (I paid $25 for the vodka and $15 for shipping initially - $40 total). I immediately responded to the message letting the customer service representative know that my Father's condo has a concierge that receives packages AND I had shipped many bottles of wine to my Father over the years without any issue. Additionally, I expressed that no one had ever called or messaged me to let me know of the issues the shipping company was having with delivery. Four days later and an additional email to customer services and I have not heard back. From a customer service perspective, this is incredibly frustrating.

This dish was served with a super tasty warm red potato salad that had yummy pieces of eggs and bacon mixed into it.\n\nPimento Cheese Appetizer - This appetizer dish featured yummy toasted bread slices smothered with yummy homemade Pimento Cheese.\nBrussels Sprouts - This appetizer (or side) dish was composed of shaved Brussels that were toasted up just right with bacon, lemon, parmesan, apple cider glaze, and whipped goat cheese.\n\nWow!

Walu was buttery  (it's sushi grade fish. Slice and done. Can't mess it up unless kept at wrong temperature) but rice was undercooked and really cold - a lot of raw rice kernels. Rice needs to be at room temp and cooked all the way. The pork belly mole just didn't go together. The mole sauce overpowered the pork belly and the dish really needed more acidity. Risotto was cold and salty. Duck confit and short rib were just shredded meat on a plate with no texture - mushy. Elk was seared nicely on the outside but the mashed potato under it was cold. Mussels were clean and tender. Did I mention all the food was cold? They were cooking it right in front of us.. I don't understand how it was all cold.... The best part was the dessert which was some sort of cookie bar.

We arrived at this fun and funky looking restaurant and were seated promptly (with a reservation). Our server came over and was very sweet, but probably also very high, if the service was any indication. We couldn't decide what to get, so ordered the Brazilian cheese bread to begin - especially as she said it took about 15 minutes to prepare. We thought she'd eventually come back to take our order...which she did, when she brought the appetizer (15 min later!). \n\nAfter much indecision, we decided on Rico with pork and the fermented tea leaf salad. 5 minutes later, she came back to tell us the \"crispies\" on the tea leaf salad were out, so we couldn't get that. We chose the broken noodle salad instead. While waiting for our entrees, we drank our all water...then waited, and waited, and waited for our server to come by. When she brought our orders, we got water (yay!). We asked for serving spoons when she brought the entrees, and she said \"sure\" and then just walked away. Forever. \n\nThe Rico was really good - a plantain covered in shredded pork and a mango vinaigrette.

I debated about leaving a review that wasn't very amicable.   We went here on November 6th for my birthday.  Made a reservation and on the notes asked for a romantic table.  We got there and it was pretty obvious that they weren't ready for us at all(just 2 of us).   I feel like our table was thrown in a spot that isn't usually there.  The reason I say this is because a few times someone tried to deliver food to tables around us that weren't theirs.  Anyway, we were seated and our server was nice but SLOW.   We were seated next to a large party of women and it was LOUD.   The whole inside was loud actually.   The appetizer(brussel sprouts) we got was great and so was my margarita(prickly pear).   Had to ask a second time for water though.  That was the extent of good.   We were seated at 6:45 and by 8:00 we still didn't have our main dishes.   I mean, it shouldn't take that long for tacos and fajitas.   So, we ended up asking for our food to go because we had somewhere to be.  I feel like our food was thrown in the boxes (by the way, their take out boxes are AWFUL).  Our waitress was very apologetic and I felt bad for her.   But we were disappointed that nothing was taken off of our bill or even that the manager didn't come to apologize.  Unfortunately,, I don't think we'll be back.

One day we were near the location and decided to stop in. First, the place is even cooler than what the ad showed and it did have a large outside garden area, which we chose due to not wanting to be inside due to Covid. Second, it was strange they did not have any menus or a code to scan at the table, so we had to go back to the front door podium to take a photo of the code to get the menus. The restaurant was almost empty but service was very slow to greet our table. Once we ordered our drinks and food, we got a chance to look around further and was really impressed with their atmosphere and could see that the patio had a lot of light strings, which would provide a really nice ambiance at night. The food and drinks were very good, definitely the highlight, but service, was the main reason why I gave it 2-stars. We had to ask for water 3 times, then the server brings out a bottle of water and that was added to our bill for a shocking $6, however, the table next to use had tap water so that definitely set us off. Since the portions were way larger than we expected, we asked for a takeout container and a side of rice. The rice never arrived and it was not on the bill, but the server did came very quickly with a handheld credit card reader, which he presented to me for payment , it had auto tip tabs starting at 20%-35%, why in the world would anyone pay 20% for the service level we received??

I smelled the dish and my senses filled with the perfect balance of truffle - next I broke open the flowers and a burst of florals filled the air as I sprinkled the petals over my ravioli - many people can overhand truffle but this sauce was superb! Biting into the mushroom mix ravioli gave an earthy savory balance to the fragrant flower petals and truffle, with a light dusting of fresh parmasean - the smell alone felt like heaven - the textures were also well paired. The waitress and bartender were attentive and accommodating. The signature fussili dish was also a light yet creamy sauce - the peas were fresh and plump and the prosciutto was not left soggy and stuck it had great gently fried texture - the textures played well together the sauce did not wilt or over power any note in this lovely symphony of fussili ,  it was well balanced and large portioned our kids split it - my husband had the vodka and crab penne and he finished the plate - the drinks were well made and the ambiance was aesthetically pleasing! I enjoyed the fine touch of a few fresh flowers on the table. I would love to come back and try the filet mignon with peppercorn sauce. You will not be disappointed here at the Italian Barrel - the wine list is extensive and although as someone with vitners in her family I usually enjoy looking it over and taking my time, we were with the kids but it was very clear they had many fine wines.

I love authentic Italian.  Unfortunately, I was hardly impressed (as a whole).  I requested an outside table, because we really wanted to experience as much city views as possible.  That didn't disappoint! The staff was friendly enough (they seemed new to the fine dining scene- if that's what they are trying to portray here). Being from Charleston, SC, I'd hardly consider this as a fine dining establishment, but that's just based on overall experience.  \n\nThe bruschetta was good. I wasn't WOWed by any means. It was just the same bread they put on the table, smothered with an over abundance of dressed tomatoes, large parm shavings, and basil. Good enough for sure, but I found it hard to keep any tomatoes on the bread, and it made for an annoying bite each time. \n\nThe lamb was absolutely cooked perfectly! No complaints there! The veggies were very delicious as well.  The chicken parm, however, was a bit lackluster, and practically flavorless.  Unfortunately, the accompanied fettuccine lacked flavor as well.  My guest actually complained to the server about it.  Normally, in a fine dining establishment, a member of management will come to your table in a matter of minutes, but no one ever arrived. I actually approached the manager and asked if he could speak with her, and he mentioned that he was never told about the situation.  He did quickly rectify the situation by removing the entree from the bill.  \n\nI didn't get to try dessert, because as I was away from the table, the server asked my guest if we were interested in dessert, and she said she was not. I was never asked once I returned and was brought the bill. I mean...I always make room for dessert. Again, just not the typical process of a fine dining establishment. \n\nOverall, meh. They did stick to Covid guidelines upon checking in with the hostess, which I appreciated. I just wish they put that much effort into the overall dining experience for their guests. \n\nI'd dine there again...if someone else was paying.", "date": "2021-11-01 18:32:44", "user": {"name": "Delilah", "review_count": 5, "yelping_since": "2020-04-28 03:22:21", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.8, "fans": 0}}], "review_count_actual": 25}

The highlight of our meal unfortunately was the bread, after receiving that it just went downhill. Our waiter was nice enough to start, my friend ordered the Carbonara and I ordered the Fettucini alfredo with chicken. Order comes, and its not correct. The waiter misheard my friend, and brought out spaghetti marinara which wasnt a big deal, I let him know it was not correct and our server, Mike, decided to get very condescending. One of his remarks were \"well I repeated myself sweetheart, those are 2 completely different things!\" and I responded saying I heard her say carbonara, I heard you say carbonara on the reply, and she was even pointing to it. My friend said it was fine, we were both starving and she would just eat the dish he brought out but he would not take our answer and took it from her, then took mine saying ill keep this warm for you. His tone and remarks made us really uncomfortable, so we called over the front desk agent who was nearby and asked for a new waiter. We were reseated to a new table, they were very apologetic and said we want to make sure you have a great evening, and we had hopes it would get better. They even reconfirmed our orders, and made sure it would be out quickly. Unfortunately, it seems noone bothered to tell our old waiter Mike this. He kept eyeballing us, making us even more uncomfortable and came right over asking why we were at a new table, why did we move, etc and I told him he should go speak with the front desk as they reseated us.  Our new waiter came over, we told him about the experience, and he said he would make sure this was resolved. He also asked for our order, a third time which was a little strange, and then went away. While we continued to wait for our food, I saw the manager asking the kitchen about our order and trying to expedite it as fast as possible. Finally get the food, waiter said he would be back with cheese. Never came back, after waiting a few minutes we both decided to start eating and were immediately met with bland food. Mine was extremely underseasoned, and I had to add pepper and salt at the table. My friends carbonara was not great either, she stated the pasta felt very crunchy and almost undercooked. The manager came over and asked how we were, I let her know the food was fine, but very underseasoned and I had to add pepper to get some taste to it. She asked if I wanted fresh cracked pepper, which I reiterated I had just done that myself..... so no. We were ready to just get out of this place as the old waiter kept throwing glances our way and making it just an uncomfortable time, and barely ate half our meals and did not take any to go. Asked for the check, were informed wine was comped and they offered a free desert (which was were the 2nd star came from, it was a nice gesture to try and salvage a bad night) but we had no faith desert would be quick or taste good and declined.

Worse, no one even checked in, our waiter just disappeared. One of us finally stood up and asked a staff, then 20 minutes later, the waiter finally appeared after 10 PM with our food. Our whole group felt terrible and had a horrible night. What added insult to injury was we observed how attentive they were to the other guests while we were walking out passing by the center and front area of the restaurant. They sat us at the back area. I started to think maybe we were discriminated because of the color of my skin. I remember asking the Italian family by us if they had to wait a while for their food, they said no, and that they really like this restaurant. I hate to think these things (that people treat other differently because of bias) when I just want to have a nice dinner with my family.

Gia, a manager, not only welcomed us warmly but remembered we had been there a couple of months ago, remembered where we sat and remembered that the friends we brought were from New York! By the way, our friends thought our dinner was one of the best they've er had!\n\nSo here is what deliciousness we had tonight: butter chicken poutine, vegetable samosa, tandoori chicken pizza, and fried spiced cauliflower for appetizers. The butter chicken poutine comes in a very hot small cast iron skillet lined with crunchy fries topped with butter chicken and cheese curds. One of my favorite dishes ever. The crunchy vegetable samosa came atop a beautiful plate of chick peas, tomato chutney with a swirl of creme. The cauliflower was crisp and flavorful, as was the pizza with chicken, cheese and grilled onions on top of fresh puffy naan.

On Wednesdays they have half priced wine if served by the glass so we had some Prosecco which went nicely with our entrees.\n\nThe menu is constantly changing with seasonal updates and new housemate pastas with delectable sauces. They also have the house favorites as well as some new sides so there is plenty to choose from no matter how often you come for a meal.\n\nWe chose a side of fried Russell sprouts and a side of cauliflower. The Brussels sprouts were nicely fried with a light sauce which was delicious. The cauliflower was good and the cheese sauce was light and tangy. I'd probably not get the cauliflower again even though it was good, as the Brussels sprouts were much tastier to us.\n\nEach entree ones with a house salad that has the best dressing! Of course there is also bread with oil and tomato and herbs so it felt as if we had more than plenty!\n\nMy e tree was a butternut squash with roasted sage and pumpkin seeds in a house made pasta. The pasta was so thin it was crispy and held the butternut squash like in a pocket. It was amazing and the brown butter sauce complimented the flavors. I could have done with a bit more filling in my pasta as I didn't get much squash flavor, but it was delicious. My husband had the ricotta gnocchi which was full of flavor and very light and airy. We heard them say it is made of ricotta instead of potato starch which gives it the light feel. He said the sauce was heaven, and he would absolutely get that entree again.\n\nOur waiter kindly remembered we were celebrating my birthday early so brought a gelato with a candle as a treat.

Every time devour would come around I would say I was coming here and never did. Well it was a random Saturday night last month when I decided to come. I did not make a reservation like I should have and of course the place was packed. The host let me know it was about an hour wait to sit in the actual dining area or I could sit at the bar. I was okay to sit at the bar and there was literally two seats in the middle for me and my friend to sit. It was a very tight squeeze since the bar was full as well but we made it work. The fella at the bar which I forgot his name was very pleasant. He acknowledge us right away and even gave us suggestions on different menu items. We ordered drinks first my friend got a cosmo and I got the venetian breeze. The bartender warned me that the venetian breeze is one of the sweetest drinks and he was right. It kind of reminded me of hi-c but with alcohol added. I liked it! I ordered the caesar salad and chicken marsala. I'm sorry I don't remember what my friend ordered. I am literally going to start taking notes when I go out with others. I know she did not complain and actually finished her meal. Me on the other hand needed a to go box. The chicken marsala was good and the chicken breast were huge. I loved the wine sauce and mushrooms. The caesar salad was just okay to me not a huge fan of the dressing. I probably would get a different salad if I came back. We were too full for desserts unfortunately. Above all I think the place is nice and its actually not near a lot of other businesses.

I had the Chicken Diablo which was spicy, very flavorful with a gentle kick of heat and spices. My husband had the Spaghetti and Meatballs.

I started with the Italian Margarita which was full of flavors.\n\nNext, I had the tasty Basil Cheese Bread served with marinara sauce. The bread is soft, topped with butter and cheese and lightly toasted. A wonderful selection!\n\nMy entree was the lunch size Chicken Marsala served with a house salad and a side of spaghetti. The chicken was topped with mushrooms and a wine sauce and was very tender. The Spaghetti was alright but did lack spices. The Salad was fresh and crisp topped with a generous out of Parmesan Cheese.\n\nThe dessert was fabulous with Italian Coffee and a slice of Tiramisu. Both were amazing and the Cheesecake was the perfect end to a delicious meal.\n\nOur server, Dale, was a 10 if I could post it. He was the only server on the patio and we wanted for nothing. He was a very professional, polite, knowledgeable and timely server. He boxed up all three of my left overs, returned with fresh coffee and answered several questions.\n\nIgnore the bland looking front of the building and find a spot on the street to park.

There wasn't a single weak spot- each dish was excellent. \nI often make my own pickles at home but the plate of perfectly blanched green beans, a slightly curry flavored collection of carrots, spicy bread and butter pickles and fried artichokes came together so well. It was a great variety of flavor and texture. The pesto style dip served with was simple and a nice compliment. \nThe chicken wings were huge! Big portion with a perfect crunch and wonderful flavor. However I was grateful I was eating with my partner. These are tricky to eat in any graceful way so maybe not a first date order. \nThe pork belly was cooked so well and the glaze on it was also so so tasty. I loved the pickled banana peppers and onions that came with. It was a great contrast to the rich pork belly. \nThey kindly brought out a complimentary birthday dessert with a candle. It was so sweet. The dessert was a lemon gelato (maybe ice cream?) and was tart, sweet and a great finish to our meal. They didn't rush us at all and made sure we were comfortable with our table upon arrival (inside, outside, our pandemic nerves were handled well). \nLast note because I just can't help myself from sharing...\nThe table next to us was a bachelorette party and the bride threw up all over the table at about 6:30.

I've always known you were good, but last night was exceptional. My cocktails were masterfully prepared, the fries were crisp and plentiful and my scallops were scrumptious. It was a night of pure perfection. \n\nI may over over indulged in the cocktails, but after the smoothness and perfection of my first one, I just wanted more and more. I started out with my usual, a Manhattan. The bartender asked if I wanted it up or on the rocks, I choose up. It was served chilled perfectly, and the mixture of the bourbon, vermouth, with the bitters was spot on. It was a perfect cocktail to sip as I munched on my fries. \n\nNow let's talk about those fries. OMG! They were served in a bowl and piled as high as the rafters. When they were placed in front of me, I could hear Diana Ross singing, Ain't No Mountain High Enough. There were so many crispy shoestring type fries, that I asked a young lady seated next to me if she'd like to share. She graciously accepted, which I was thankful for, as it was way to much for even this foodie. \n\nMy next  cocktail was my second most ordered, an Old Fashioned. My heart skipped a beat, as it was absolutely the best Old Fashioned I've had in STL. It was severed with one large cylinder type ice cube and a sliver of orange peel. It was so smooth and refreshing. It went perfectly with my Scallops. \n\nAnyone who knows me well, knows I have a deep love for Scallops. They are my absolute favorite seafood. I follow TB on FB and when I saw they had added them as an entree to their menu, I got here as fast as my work and social schedule would let me. \n\nMy entree was six huge sea scallops, I prefer sea over bay. I'm going to give it to you straight from the menu - XO marmalade, cornbread-pistachio crumble, celery root pumpkin seed oil. Let me tell you, the crumble had my toes curling and my taste-buds doing a happy dance. The menu also tells you that, \"large plates\" requires a longer cooking time. Trust me, it is well worth the wait. Enjoy a cocktail as you wait, it really isn't that long. \n\nFor dessert, I had another cocktail. If they did a masterful job with a Manhattan and a Old Fashioned, I had to see what they'd do with a Sazerac. I've traveled to the City of New Orleans where this cocktail is famous and those bartenders need to come try one at TB to see how they're suppose to be done. It was a wonderful finale to a great meal. \n\nThe young man seated next to me enjoyed a Pork Burger and when it was presented to him, I couldn't resist taking a picture. I'm a Yelper, it just comes natural. He asked me if I've had on before and I assured him that I had, but my heart belongs to scallops. \n\nBeing seated at the bar as usual, both bartenders on duty were friendly and attentive to all of us. I appreciate their friendliness and professionalism. \n\nI'll be back? - Absolutely \n\nWhen: December 13, 2019\nWhy: Scallops now a featured Large Plate", "date": "2019-12-14 23:49:17", "user": {"name": "Steven", "review_count": 1562, "yelping_since": "2010-08-08 15:05:23", "elite": "2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 3.92, "fans": 401}}, {"review_id": "Iws7zgq2iy8lU8HwGtibFQ", "user_id": "ocoUDFAd_v-fwfLsuOyB3w", "business_id": "_gVyuTRb_6HM-SNtqbpevQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Love the ambience.

One of my favorite things is as well is that this is the perfect restaurant to eat with a group of vegans and non-vegans as there is a little bit for everyone without compromising menu, flavor, and freshness. I highly recommend trying any of their three locations in the Reno/Sparks area. \n\nService\nOur server was fast and friendly. The server was also able to confidently answer any/all the questions I had about their vegan food and vegan modified options. \n\nEnvironment\nThe restaurant has a huge dining area with tables of different sizes. Even though there are a lot of tables they are still well spaced apart to avoid it feeling cramped. They also have a lot of art and pictures on the wall. \n\nFood\n\nJackfruit BBQ Sandwich\nThis sandwich was nearly perfect at replicating a pulled pork sandwich.

If it sounds like it'd be good, it's probably great. Gnocchi was fresher tasting than I've ever had it, the seeds and butternut squash melded together with the sauce to make an unforgettable dish, will be getting this again if I go back. \nOther side of that coin is if it says \"anchovy butter\" you can probably bet it's anchovy+butter, and not something that tastes good.

The creator of this dessert knew how to balance unique flavor profiles into one dish without any hampering the  intentions of the former. I only got a couple salty bites, but maybe that's all I needed, because that's all I got. The waiter said that those salty parts were bits of dehydrated Kalamata olives, a trick I have never heard of. Ingenious indeed.

Henrietta Red is a stunning  venue with a great menu. This restaurant is beautiful- a magnificent marble oyster bar running the full length of one of the rooms-like something from another era. We chose to sit outside ( it was a beautiful mid-October evening). We had glasses of cava to celebrate oysters and being together after a long and difficult year, and switched to a delicious white, Daisy Chain from Ricca Terra for the rest of the meal. A perfect compliment to the menu we chose. \n\nThe service was attentive and professional- our waitron was very well informed and guided us through the menu. She suggested that we choose plates to share, and explained the way the menu was designed- start with lighter dishes first, moving through to 'meatier' dishes. The pacing of dishes coming out of the kitchen was masterful-neither too rushed or too slow: a relaxed roll...\n\nWe started with two dozen plump and briny gulf coast Alabama oysters to share. They didn't disappoint! The crudo that followed was superb-the balance of lime and thinly sliced red onion, a crunch of pistachio and a hint of watermelon was masterful. The beetroot and apple salad with a tahini dressing was cleansing and fresh, with just enough tartness. The textures were just right-paper-thin apple and a delicate hint of lime and mint. \nWe followed with the scallops in a mustard cream sauce-plump, juicy and generous. Next to arrive was the crab dip served with warm wood fired bread which gave it a slightly charred flavor. Complete heaven! \n\nThe last dish of the evening was the beef tartare, delivered on a platter with a tarragon drizzle and sourdough toast, which rounded off our choices without being heavy or overwhelming. We are in Nashville until Monday and as we are staying in the neighborhood, we plan to come back for a cocktail/ Jell-O shot on Sunday evening!

I, the passenger on my cellphone, looked up as my boyfriend made a comment about how he was trying to get around them for quite some time as he thought they were being rude and he managed to circle around them with a little wave (with plenty of room to spare) to drive to the entrance of the restaurant to drop me off as I have a knee injury and can't walk long distances. As I was waiting in line to put my name down, the blonde lady and her husband quite literally shoved past me and stood directly in front of me. I was shocked. I told the person at the front \"excuse me, but this woman just walked right in front of me.\" The blonde lady whirled around and said \"yeah well YOU JUST ALMOST HIT ME WITH YOUR CAR!\" Her husband said \"yeah you , or your boyfriend or whatever just almost hit us, yes we're those people you almost hit!!!\" Again....I was shocked. Thinking back to the very  brief encounter of driving past them, where they did not look upset or angry? The person behind the register was shocked also and clearly did not know how to handle the situation. The couple again loudly stated \"she just tried to run us down.\" She catered to the white older couple and told them they were able to talk to the host at the stand to be seated. I responded with \"this is a really mature way for adults to act.\" The blonde lady, assumingely felt some sort of remorse for her actions, then told the host with a roll of her eyes and not even looking at me that she \"thinks I was here first, so to go ahead.\" \n\nI was so excited to take my boyfriend to this restaurant,  as a Butler alum and it's been more than a few years since I've been to the Broad Ripple area. Now I was embarrassed and shaky and trying to hold back tears. The host was so nice when I told him what happened and checked back on us later into our meal, which was great. Our waitress, Liz, also made the rest of our experience extremely pleasant. And I was so glad for them. \n\nI guess I just wanted to say that just because someone looks a certain way or is a certain age or looks like they \"have money,\" doesn't automatically put them in the right. Which is why I took a star off. This lady was pulling a classic white victim card and I'm sad that she felt entitled to walk in front of me and yell at me for something that 1) DID NOT EVEN HAPPEN and 2) even if it did, as a passenger, I have no control over. However, just for the record, my boyfriend isn't driving around like a maniac trying to run down civilians just for some scrambled eggs. \n\nMaybe it's because I walked into the restaurant before them that pissed them off? Maybe it's because I am a young Latina woman that she felt privileged enough to exert some power? Maybe it's because of their socioeconomic status? Either way if something like this ever happens to you, keep your head held high and don't stoop to their level.

She ordered the greenie omelette and added smoked salmon. Everything in the omelette tasted so fresh, like it just came out of the garden! I had to try the pear lavender latte and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it! They have milk alternatives so I was able to sub almond milk with no problems. Last, the blood orange mimosa is a great choice! But then again, doesn't a mimosa make any brunch better?

Rooster & Till has a rustic farm vibe with old school drop down Edison bulbs that still manages to bring an upscale vibe to the place. The menu is incredibly small with only 13 items and does not feature steak or lobster or anything fancy that you would expect to spend a lot on. The menu definitely did not feature anything I would go out of my way to get but came here on the recommendation of a girlfriend. \n\nThe Seared Foie Gras came with must 1 tiny piece of foie gras paired with Huckleberry minus 8 Gastrique, Cashew Pear Vanilla, & Vanilla Pear for $24. The Foie Gras was way too salty. For the price, I should have gotten 4 times the serving size. 5/10 \n\nThe Seared Scallops came with just 3 scallops paired with salsa Macha, Boniato Puree, Lamb Neck Agridulce, & Lamb Consumme for $30. For the price I should have got 4 scallops with more filling garnishments. 7/10 \n\nThe Gnocchi came with just 1 small plate of Braised Short Rib, Ricotta, pickled peperonata, Parisian style for $24. For the price, the serving size should have been triple the size. 6/10 \n\nThe Cobia Collar Plate came with just 1 small plate of fried Cobia, Nuoc Cham, Thai Chili's, & Cilantro and had a nice flavor for $21. This dish was over-fried and way too fishy smelling and barely edible. 4/10 \n\nBe prepared to get tiny tiny dishes so you'll have to spend at least $100 per person with at least 4 small plates per person at Rooster & Till or you will end up leaving hungry. The Rooster & Till does not offer a large enough selection of options with just 13 menu items, is not the best value, portion sizes should be much much larger for the pice, but at least many of these dishes are filled with ingredients so obscure and unique you probably will not find them at any other restaurant!

I used to go here when the restaurant was half the size before it took over the shop next door. There's a large bar in the center with the kitchen behind it and tables throughout the perimeter of the restaurant. Beautifully designed and decorated. Chefs Ferrell Alvarez and Ty Rodriguez do an amazing job with combining unlikely food pairings to make beautiful and fantastic dishes. The chefs tasting menu has two options. With and without the wine pairings. I chose just the food option. All the members of your party need to have the tasting menu if one person wants it because of the timing of when the food comes out, \nThe first course was Lamb Tataki: pistachio green harissa, green strawberries, tahini beet root dahl. \nSecond course was the Kathi roll: onion pakora, sweet potato almond chutney, raita, red garlic chili smear. \nThird course Sea bass belly: chili cumin long beans, korma curry, coriander coconut chutney \nFourth course: Fried sweetbreads: caulilini raisin aschar, curried potato croquette, smoked vindaloo, yogurt\nFifth course: goat cheese, rhubarb nectar, burnt carrot ganache, lavosh \nSixth course: Cardamom turmeric meringue, green mango, mango jelly, coconut milk snow. \n\nWhat a flavor explosion in every bite! Hard to decide on my favorites but I would say the sea bass belly and I just loved the burnt carrot ganache with the goat cheese. My friend loved the Kathi roll. The presentation was just as professional as the flavors. This is a once in a lifetime experience that you will pay for but it's worth it. \nOur server was so knowledgeable with all the items on the menu, the wines and beer. Because they don't have a liquor license they have to be creative with some of their cocktails. Had the Yuzu margarita served with Sake. It was absolutely amazing. \nThe restaurant is in a strip mall, so there's a few parking spots in the center but there's another lot across the street to park. They are only open for dinner Wednesday to Saturday from 5-9 so I highly suggest a reservation.\nWhat a fantastic experience, solidifies my love of this restaurant as number one in Tampa bay.", "date": "2021-07-14 10:51:39", "user": {"name": "Lara", "review_count": 689, "yelping_since": "2016-03-20 14:41:16", "elite": "2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.64, "fans": 85}}, {"review_id": "yht_BeoapiTZaY3ZCK0PVA", "user_id": "X-rAIG5LZ17CXoSPeX5Uzw", "business_id": "n5i09tgSuzv9ZeIN9Qe5oQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "First time back since COVID got a couple of seats at the bar no wait on a Saturday night.

When it first opened, I remember the menu being fun, diverse and creative. Then, in my opinion, the menu became smaller and more Mediterranean focused, which isn't my style, and so we hadn't returned in some time. Recently wanted a quick couple hours out of the house for some small bites and drinks, as I wasn't feeling a full blown dinner. The other tapas places in town I refuse to support, so I checked out the menu at Centro and again, it was diversified, creative! \n\nIt is first come, first serve with the Covid stuff, so we came on a Saturday around 3:30 to hit their happy hour. We sat in the back patio where it is covered, but they turned on the heater for us too. Turned out the happy hour that day was on drinks only, only a slight bummer as I was wanting to have some oysters, I guess in preparation of their new spring menu debut to happen in a few days.\n\nI started with the Scallop Crudo, and the Sticky Ribs, and Cory got the Al Pastor Tacos and Filthy Fries. He had a couple of beers ($4 on HH) while I asked for a creative mocktail ($4) I got a bright orange drink with a pretty lime rind twist. I don't know what was in it, we thought maybe mango and lime? but I would describe it as a sophisticated sunny delight. I thought I wasn't that hungry, but then ordered the Beets to help calm down the spiciness of the ribs. \n\nThe scallop crudo was a surpise in that it was bay scallops and not thinly sliced divers scallops which was what I was expecting. The scallops were fresh and just sweet enough without being overpowering, and served with super sweet peas, salty red tobiko and drizzled with chili oil all sitting in a yuzi broth. I really enjoyed the components of this dish. The ribs were also good, I like a crust on the outside and a bit drier meat, but still tasty, not road kill, the meat came off the bone completely too. They were just unexpectedly spicy and the pickled carrots didn't do much to cut the burn (I am a wimp with spice, but even my husband said they were spicy). The beet salad was a good portion, lovely baby beets with the root tails still on, whimsical touch there. The goat cheese was the typical creamy and tangy. But really the star of the show here was the candied fennel sprinkled throughout. I loved the crunch and the pop of sweetness when combined with the tangy goat cheese. Really simple, but executed well dish. Cory really enjoyed the tacos, they were loaded and not overly greasy. The fifthly fries were also a hit, and filling! The cream sauce they put on them was delicious though. \n\nI wanted to order so many more things on the menu that was to be disappearing, the quail, octopus, desserts! But my body limited me. I really feel like the prices are amazing with the small plates almost all being $9, a couple might be $10. Then the big larger plates seemed to go around $14-$16, again, I think a great value. I am super excited to come back and try the new spring 2021 menu though! Additionally, they are opening a location at the Village at Ranch Harrah, which is closer to my house, so truly stoked for it. \n\nSorry for the wordiness, I guess I get excited now when I go out and get to be blown away by the food!

A long standing establishment that was spoken fondly of by every local I conversed with. I myself was swooned by the flavors that happen under this roof. Make sure you get a reservation. It looks like 5PM is the easiest time to get one, but by 6pm, the place was packed.\n\nThe veal dumplings are pure pleasure. The teriyaki sauce is plate licking good. The honey glaze only enhances the indulgence, while there is a noticeable spiciness that lingers in the backdrop. The veal itself is a nice touch of gaminess but coming off more like a sausage. I like that you can order them as a single piece rather than the full order, especially since I wanted to taste as much as I could on the menu.\n\nThe lobster turnover were also a highly decadent item. Not only are you getting flaky soft phyllo dough, but that brandy cream is the star of the meal. \nThe lobster, although small, was cooked just right texture wise. You can also order these by a single piece.\n\nThe beignets they serve at the table are lovely display of their bakery skills, but that slightly funky whipped butter is the real item to get excited about. It can be addictive!\n\nThe ribs are Ok, but the sauce is what you really get excited for. The midwest think they can smoke ribs, but being from texas, they still dont hold a candle to what we do. They have a nice pull from the bone, but thats about it. They dont seem as rendered as they could be.\n\nThe crudo is a lovely interpretation of a peruvian dish with north american ingredients. The slightly acidic popcorn, along with its slightly soft texture is a great play of textures on the tongue. Light on the stomach but packs a tasty punch. This is one of those contemplative dishes. If you are there while it's in season, get it. I have a feeling the different seasons of crudo are all good.\n\nThe snickers dessert should have been described as deconstructed, but it didnt matter with how delicious it was! The salty caramel sauce, the tangy chocolate ice cream, that nougat marshmallow fluff, and coarsely chopped peanuts all made this a delightful meal. Luckily for me, this dessert appeared back on the menu only a week before I arrived. It was frequently requested by guest that the chef decided it was time to resurrect this beauty.

Again, the sizes were more than generous and we shared, but could not finish all of it.\n\nOverall, the food, ambiance, and staff made this a night to remember and we will certainly be back.  The prices were more than reasonable and made this a restaurant that is not just for special occasions but is affordable to visit on a regular basis.", "date": "2021-10-16 15:14:37", "user": {"name": "Jim", "review_count": 28, "yelping_since": "2011-04-22 02:13:13", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.45, "fans": 0}}, {"review_id": "xWOo-o3yJjLd-HuCkkAXhg", "user_id": "M2xIRdHZBleiwQOcD5jJ7A", "business_id": "WzpWEuVWY-6Xh37wc44GiA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "It was my hubby who choose the restaurant this time as he knows i am a fan of fine dining. The restaurant entrance resides at the corner of a building, which is tricky cause who would know there is such a nice restaurant inside. This is authenticity it self. \nIt has an old vibe, tables closets chairs are all dark wood, lamps are dim and closer to each table rather than being high closer to the ceiling which adds a romantic vibe.\nOur waiter was a young very delightful, and calm gentleman. He was knowledgeable for what there was on the menu and the ingredients.\nFood wise , we got Crudo and lobster turnovers for appetizers. Crudo was make of Fresh raw Hamachi, when when I say fresh it means Fresh. The lobster turnovers is small slices of lobster rolled in Phyllo which was crispy topped with tomato sauce that had some lobster sauce taste to it. \nI thought about not sharing this plate but I had to leave a space for whats coming next. \nAs for main plates, they come with salad.\ni got scallops and it was maybe one of the best scallops i have had. The portions were of good size not too slimy, had buttery taste. I really recommend the scallops.\nBeef tenderloin was medium done as requested, was juicy and had right amount of seasoning.\nPS: this is for restaurant, house salad needs bit more flavor. The dressing was super light mostly flavorless. Adding extra virgin oil, salt, balsamic vinegar /lime juice will do the job.\n\nOverall the experience was amazing and i give it 5/5 .", "date": "2021-10-04 23:20:12", "user": {"name": "Nourhan", "review_count": 38, "yelping_since": "2018-01-14 09:52:45", "elite": "2021", "average_stars": 4.37, "fans": 2}}, {"review_id": "MN5P_OFV6v8xjzyka73gLA", "user_id": "7lJCi9mDj6KMgyBwJq2LmQ", "business_id": "WzpWEuVWY-6Xh37wc44GiA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Dined at Sidney Street Cafe last night and it was great.

The egg roll was good, typical egg roll taste. \n\nPadthai was way too much sauce so it was wet. The flavor was quite sour than sweetness side. I asked the spicy level 4 but this padthai wasn't spicy at all. They gave a little cup of chili powder, I guess it meant to sprinkled on your padthai to make it spicy as your liking. \n\nPanang curry was awful. Too thick, and I didn't taste any curry at all. It was too peanuty flavor instead mix with curry paste. I got it that panang curry is all about peanut but this one was over powering peanut flavor, it should called peanut curry.

It's complex and herbaceous, and just damn delicious. \n\nThe dish I got on this evening was swimming in a rich panang curry like sauce with a peanut flavor. The only thing similar to the other dish I knew and loved as spicy spicy catfish were the items in that sauce. While it was tasty, it absolutely was not the dish I'd ordered before and it left me very disappointed and dissatisfied.\n\nThe Greet Curry with shrimp was light in flavor and incredibly watery, and instead of coating the rice, it turned it soupy.

Last week I was pondering Brunch... I wanted to try something new... Something different... Somewhere I have never been... A tough order to fill, but with some thought I managed  to come up with this...  Fond is on the corner of 11th and Tasker. The Chef-owners Lee Styer and Jessie Prawlucki, a husband-and-wife team have a wonderful story.  \"Chefs Styer and Prawlucki met as students, at the Culinary Institute of America, in 2003. After honing their skills in a few different kitchens, they opened Fond in 2009, then married. Today, they live in South Philadelphia with their two young children. Chef Styer uses techniques he learned working with lauded chefs including Georges Perrier and Jean- Marie Lacroix to transform fresh, seasonal ingredients into a bold menu of globally-inspired dishes. Chef Prawlucki, who worked her way up to Pastry Chef at Le Bec-Fin, prepares desserts layered with flavor and texture, as well as freshly baked breads to complement her husband's dinner menus.\" They clearly share a passion for food that  can be tasted and felt... I found a single seat at the bar where I introduced myself to my server Shane. After previewing the cocktails I naturally ordered The St. Germain Spritz. Elderflower liqueur, sparkling wine, club soda, paying Homage to my friend Beth, who is a representative for St Germain.(See Quality Cocktail in the Valley). It was REFRESHING !!! I started with Escargot chartreuse, hazelnut, garlic, toast. The snails were served in a bowl of melted butter with garlic, chartreuse and crushed hazelnuts. A couple slices of toast that were fried in butter were provided to sop up the juices. They were perfect ! I then ordered The Mushroom Omelet, tallegio, maitake, truffle oil. If you like mushrooms, this is an omelet for you ! The flavors of the maitake mushrooms and the truffle oil dominated the omelet and were complimented well with the tallegio cheese. THIS OMELET EXUDED MUSHROOM FLAVOR !!! It was all beautifully presented on a plate with greens and fried potatoes and toast. A couple more coctails and I was happily on my way !  I REALLY enjoyed Fond, and I will be back for more...

Fond is located in South Philly, near Passyunk Ave and we were supposed to go for New Year's Eve two years ago. We ended up canceling last minute due to undesirable conditions but it's been on my Philly food bucket list for years. Fond is of the restaurants continuing services with delivery and curbside options. Not only are they offering plenty of sandwiches, soups, and prepared foods, but they also have a mini-market. This market contains household items like salt, flour, and eggs, but also includes necessities like toilet paper, wine, and beer.\n\nWe ordered a ton of items, enough for lunch and dinner, and even grabbed some beer. Although the beer was more than what we would typically pay for a 6-pack, we ended up getting a delicious blood orange IPA. We were given the Tommy Knocker Mountain Town Craft Beer, brewed in Colorado. Definitely the best blood orange IPA we ever had. It was lite on the hops and the orange just tasted like fresh juice. It was so nice to be able to order food, salt (since we ran out a few days ago), and beer - one-stop shop. I will always continue to support local restaurants. \nCorned Beef Sammy: The sandwich was served on marbled rye (the best!) and had a large serving of corned beef. It was topped with Thousand Island dressing, Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut. The meat was moist and pretty tasty. It wasn't the best corned beef sandwich we've had, but definitely tasty.\n\nBahn Mi: I've been craving a Bahn mi for weeks now and was so excited that it was on the menu. Although not traditional, it was served with chicken. The vegetables were pickled perfectly. I would have liked more pickled juice or heat (like extra jalapenos). The bread was so soft. I love when Bahn mis have soft bread; I think it kind of defeats the purpose of having succulent meat if the bread is so hard to chew through. Definitely hit my craving and I can't wait to recreate this.\n\nThai Chicken Curry: We recently had curry from a local Thai restaurant and I've been craving it ever since. The curry is part of their prepared foods and so glad we ordered this. It was a large portion that had plenty of veggies. I was surprised that it came with chopped potatoes. Is this normal? Can someone confirm this? The flavor was great with just the right amount of heat. We ended up making a side of rice and having it for dinner the following day. It kept great and highly recommend.\n\nItalian Hoagie: We inhaled this for lunch the following day. The bread was super soft, just like the Bahn mi. The sandwich was full of meat - a mix of ham and salami. It was topped with provolone, lettuce, tomato, and onion. I would have liked it to have some oil and vinegar, but glad it didn't make the bread soggy for the following day.\n\nI know this isn't typical of what they would normally serve but it was really tasty. The food traveled well and kept for leftovers. I would highly recommend ordering takeout from Fond Bistro. I can't wait to come back when things return to \"normal\".", "date": "2020-05-07 18:42:01", "user": {"name": "Stacy", "review_count": 95, "yelping_since": "2013-02-17 15:39:43", "elite": "2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.42, "fans": 10}}, {"review_id": "E7t-PkM49K_7ENXdPSI8pg", "user_id": "c_Ap6RsFcZpqWN9QM-qIlQ", "business_id": "T_6e0SgNuKotySgVS8O1UQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "RW Review: This is a cute romantic spot in south philly.

I think it was a little too much turmeric. We tried the kale salad and it was good but nothing that special. \n\nDesserts were amazing and delicious. Loved the chocolate chip cookie. It was crispy on the edges and was sweet and salty. \n\nWe also tried the kombucha (delicious and refreshing). I got a couple vanilla lattes with oat milk and they were great too. \n\nAll and all - let's me honest. I came here to try some serious vegan chicken and I would come back over and over again.

The food is wonderful even if you're not vegetarian or vegan. However, they are docked a star because a year into Covid measures, it's still an exercise in patience in getting your food.\n\nI first ran across this place years ago when a group of restaurants did a cupcake crawl. I think this was right around when Hostess had shut down operations (temporarily, though no one knew it at the time), so one of the first things I tried from here was the Fauxstess cupcake (much better than the original). Eventually, I tried their burger. This was long before impossible burgers were even remotely trendy, and I was amazed by how great they were.\n\nI've since ordered a variety of items from there, including a cake (which was amazing), and though everything is delicious, I keep going back to the Maine Event cookie and make it funky burger. In my mind, those are the stars of the menu. If you can't make a decision, get those.\n\nWhen Covid restrictions hit, SweetArt closed for quite awhile until they came up with their curbside option. Order online and then you park nearby with your blinkers on. I tried this several times in the first few months of the option, and it wasn't uncommon for me to not get a text at all or to be waiting an hour after my pickup time to get a text. Eventually, I just started going here less and less, as the wait times were too unpredictable.\n\nOne caveat to that, I did go once during the week, and the wait times were similar to other restaurants, but a year into a Covid restrictions, it was 30 minutes after the Square estimate before my food was ready on a Saturday. The food was great and the staff apologetic, but keep a lot of buffer time if you plan to order food on a Saturday.

All the appetizers were just okay. \nThe meatballs had an interesting texture.  I should have know the brussel sprouts would be soft by the \"wilted\" description but I hoped they would be crispier.  Fries were good with a nice aioli.  I wouldn't get the meatballs or sprouts again though.  The charcuterie and mezze sounded delicious and would like to try those next time. \n\nAll of the mains were amazing.  For the mains we got the Spanish fire roasted octopus, which was so tasty and the Octopus was cooked perfectly.  The chorizo and white beans were a nice touch.  Would highly recommend this.  \nWe also go the Onglet - 8oz hanger steak and the NY strip.  Meat was cooked perfectly, sides were delicious. The NY is juicy and a large plate.  Can serve 1-2. \nService was wonderful and we got the bottle of MacRostie - a Pinot noir which was smooth and nice. \n\nGreat for date night or large groups.

We started off with a cheese board, a meat board, the mezze , and the panko encrusted artichokes . The boards were good but I've had better ones,  these were average . The mezze had roasted eggplant,  with goat cheese , a carrots raised salad and lavash. I'm not an eggplant fan but everything on that dish was delicious, it was a great combo. The artichoke was good  but there were a few tough parts of the artichoke. After some conversation and some wine, we decided to order a few more items, the cauliflower gratinee, Spanish meatballs, pomme frites, roasted octopus and the crab and beet salad. \nThe cauliflower was delicious,  it was topped with bread crumbs and roasted. I'm not sure what else was on it but it was cooked perfectly. The Spanish meatball were tender and were served in a romesco sauce , this dish might have been my favorite . Soooo good. I don' t eat seafood so I can only tell you how the rest of the party felt about the dishes with seafood. Everyone raved about the octopus except for one friend who felt it tasted like fish. \u200d\n\nEverything was so good, the service, the setting, decor and the food, everything..This is one place you should definitely go to if you haven't been here yet.

Open for many years and a fixture of Central McDougall, it's almost impossible that you haven't paid them a visit at least once. Padmanadi has even recently opened a second southside location, which only makes their delicious food more accessible. VUE Weekly named them #1 Best Vegetarian 2018 and #1 Best Vegan 2018, while Edmonton Journal called Padmanadi the Best Vegan/Vegetarian Restaurant 2020. This should come as no surprise because they have practically been dominating the vegan/vegetarian scene since the day that their doors first opened. So what's the deal at Padmanadi? What is the food all about? Owned and operated by Indonesian immigrants, they serve Indonesian, Chinese, Thai, and Indian plant-based dishes. Everything is vegan. But let me assure you that this food will completely change the way that you think about the vegan experience. As an omnivore myself, you will always hear me say \"if all vegan food was this delicious, I would never eat meat again\" when I visit Padmanadi.  The original restaurant is not situated in the greatest area of the city, north east of downtown. But don't make the mistake of letting the location deter you - everything else more than makes up for it! The vibrant and bright restaurant lights up the street and welcomes you inside. I've always adored their beautiful and fresh space, and it's big too! Every aspect is well thought out and perfectly appropriate, combining the feelings of Southeast Asia and veganism to a tee. The gorgeous bamboo wood, pops of colour, and the centerpiece of the dining room; a massive Buddha statue adorned with flowers. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming, making it quite apparent that this is the type of place that really cares about its' people - staff and customers alike.  The menu is extensive and you almost have to remind yourself that none of the dishes contain animal products - especially when you find yourself face to face with the \"vegetarian meat dishes\" section. Confusing? Just keep reminding yourself that there is no actual meat within the restaurant and let them show you their wizardry. I have personally visited the restaurant many times in the past, in fact you'll find them listed in the Worldwide Faves section of this website. However, it had been many years since my last visit and I was very excited to revisit some of my favourite flavours. Seated at a comfortable table, I looked over the familiar menu and didn't notice too many changes. It was a relief! I ordered all of my old stand-bys and even tried something new. First, always, had to be the Crispy Chicken Strips (Veggie chicken fried to perfection & served with homemade hot sauce - $10.95). My absolute favourite thing on the menu. How I had missed these! An instant craving, you might never guess in a million years that you aren't eating real chicken. Except that it's better than chicken. Every piece is moist and impossibly tender on the inside. The outside is coated in the most wonderfully crispy, crunchy and salty batter. The sweet and spicy chili sauce has a great zing to it, an ideal accompaniment. There is only one word to describe these magic morsels: ADDICTIVE. You have to try these just so that you can be in on the amazingness.  Next, our main courses arrived and I had to stick to more of my old favourites, starting with the Ginger Beef (Soy beef strips, sweet bell peppers and julienne carrots in a tangy ginger sauce. Our best seller - $15.95). We also grabbed an order of Coconut Rice ($2.75) to go along with everything because rice is life. I especially love the sweetness of coconut rice and was happy to see it as an option on the menu. It looks just like ginger beef... But it's not. The crispy pieces of not-beef are tossed in a thick glaze that actually tastes like real, fresh ginger. The vegetables are bright and full of flavour. And you'll find yourself wondering why you would ever bother ordering \"real\" ginger beef when you could just enjoy this instead (and feel less like trash afterwards).  We also ordered the Curry Chicken (Our signature dish! Our famous homemade rich and delicious yellow curry coconut with veggie chicken, potatoes and vegetables - $16.95), which I truthfully don't think I'd ever tried before. I was glad to get something new into the mix and this seemed like the exact right dish to bring into the fold. This dish packs a spicy kick but boy is it delicious! The curry itself is velvety smooth, full of sweet and spicy flavour. The potatoes are incredibly tender. But it's the not-chicken that is the real star. All we kept saying is that it tasted better than real chicken! The main reason for this is because each piece is so incredibly tender, boasting a consistently uniform texture that you don't get from real chicken. It's like they were able to take all of best things about chicken, harness that pow", "date": "2021-11-03 18:07:44", "user": {"name": "Erika", "review_count": 135, "yelping_since": "2020-01-26 05:19:18", "elite": "20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.3, "fans": 17}}, {"review_id": "J6MyFI6OtTNHpkxKjFdIgA", "user_id": "K0jJMr27XWfHkSLMSqFf2Q", "business_id": "hc0KmC42EzjXbC83eMIDMg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "I absolutely love the food at Padmanadi!

The cauliflower was not the star in the kung pao cauliflower dish. And whoa, was it saucy !

Maybe dial down the sauce so that there can still be harmony between all the dishes ordered? (And also spare the poor cauliflower from having an identity crisis ?)

Nothing was off limits! What?!\n\nYeah. So, I ordered the chicken avocado cream sandwich and the tomato soup. The sandwich was brimming with freshness, even the roasted chicken. Soooo good! The tomato basil soup was equally yummy, but they served it up way too hot, so it was a while before I could even take a taste. Full of flavor though.\n\nMy husband ordered the vegan burger with a side of buffalo chicken pizza and a hand held pie. Yeah, that's right, he ordered three meals at once, with the plan to have more when he got home. He's a glutton for good food!\n\nThis place is LOADED with gluten free and vegan treats. It's a GF bakery, by nature, and their breads, crusts and what have you are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, unless it's a muffin or something, of course. The texture of their baked goods are off the chart delicious. You would be hard pressed to even guess that it's gluten free because they're THAT GOOD.\n\nNot only that, they have a huge covered outdoor patio for you to hang out in and eat. Social distanced and everything. People even had their dogs with them. It's a cool joint. The inside decor is all eco-cool and artsy - \"crafted\" organically, if you will. Love it!\n\nDon't believe me? That's cool, try it out for yourself.
